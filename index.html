            INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT
                           
            A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
            descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
            Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
            plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Onward Chauncey, to the highest
             room of the tallest tower! Where
             my princess awaits rescue from her
             handsome Prince Charming.
                           
            Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
            wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
            bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another
            stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
            In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
            effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back
            stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
            lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
            of a cheaply painted backdrop.
                           
            The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the
            audience.

                            PINOCCHIO
             Me too.
                           
            Pinocchio's nose grows as he is caught in the lie.
                           
            Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Whoa there, Chauncey!
                           
            He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He
            strikes a dramatic pose.
                           
            A Princess leans from a tower window.
                           
                            ACTRESS
             Hark! The brave Prince Charming
             approach-ith.
                           
            Prince Charming puffs his chest out.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay
             the monster that guards you and
             take my place as rightful King.
                           
            An old couple at a table look confused.
                           
                            OLD LADY
             (to old man)
             What did she say?
                           
            Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
            him.
                           
            A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage.
                           
                            OGRE
             Grrrrrrr!
                           
            The crowd erupts into applause. The Fairytale Creatures
            cheer.

                            GINGERBREAD MAN
             Yea! Shrek!
                           
            At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
            Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the
            monster.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Prepare foul beast to enter into a
             world of pain with which you are
             not familiar!
                           
            He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Do you mind?
                           
            Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on
            stage. It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade.
                           
                            GINGERBREAD MAN

            The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then
            tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again.
            The tower facade starts to topple.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (CLEARS THROAT)
             Prepare foul beast-
                           
            Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
            falling. He cringes.
                           
            The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is
            unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The
            crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes
            his mangled sword at the audience.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             (shaking his sword again)
             Someday you'll be sorry.

             (O.S.)
             We already are!
                           
            They laugh again. Prince Charming throws down his sword,
            picks up his hobby horse and exits.
                           
                            OGRE
             Grrrrrrr!
                           
            The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage.
                           
                           
            INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                           
            Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads
            to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it.
            He opens it.
                           
                           
            EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
                           
            Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make-
            shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.
                           
            Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far
            Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince
            Charming breaks down and cries.
                           
            He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
            to the vanity. "Don't stop believing! Mommy's Little Angel"
            is written on the picture.

                            (HEAVY SOBS)
             Oh mommy.
                           
            He weeps again and then looks back at the picture. A
            determined change grows across his face.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Oh, you're right. I can't let this
             happen. I can't.
                           
            Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill. His
            expression hardens. He stands and faces the castle. He
            holds his chin up high.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             I am the rightful King of Far Far
             Away and I promise you this mother.
             I will restore dignity to my
             throne!
                           
            A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face.
            He peels it off and looks at the headline. His eyes tense
            and narrow.
                           
             PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
             And this time, no one will stand in
             my way!
                           
            In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
            crowd.
                           
            Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists.
                           
                           
            EXT. CASTLE - MORNING
                           
            The camera booms down from the Far Far Away sign. The sun
            rises and the birds sing.
                           
                           
            INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                           
            The sun shines through the bedroom window as the camera pans
            over to Shrek and Fiona waking up.
                           
                            SHREK

            Shrek breathes in and smiles.
                           
                            SHREK

             I know. Isn't it wonderful?
                           
            The bedroom doors fly open and Donkey and the Dronkeys rush
            in. The Dronkeys head right for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek
            cowers beneath the bedclothes.
                           
                            DONKEY
                            (SINGING)
             "Good morning! Good morning!"
                           
            Shrek sinks further into the blankets as the Dronkeys
            exuberantly lick him. Fiona is amused.
                           
            Donkey starts to sing "Good Morning" from Singin' in the Rain
            as he enters the room.
                           
                            DONKEY
                            (SINGING)
             "The sun is shining through! Good
             morning! Good morning.
             (coming closer and closer
                            TO SHREK)
             "To you!"
                            (TO SHREK)
             "And you!"
                            (TO DRONKEY)
             And you!
                           
            The Dronkeys fly out of the room, knocking down everything in
            their path.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Oh, they grow up so fast.
                           
            Shrek, greatly annoyed, lifts his hand and snuffs out a
            little fire on the bed left behind by the Dronkeys.
                           
                            SHREK
             Not fast enough.
                           
            Puss leaps onto the bed.
                           
                            PUSS
             Okay. You have a very full day
             filling in for the King and Queen.
             There are several functions that

                            SHREK
             Great! Let's get started.
                           
            Shrek immediately pulls the covers up over his head and
            starts to snore.
                           
                            DONKEY
             C'mon, lazy bones, time to get
             movin'!
                           
            Donkey yanks the sheets off of Fiona and Shrek. He is
            surprised to see Shrek's bare legs.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Aaahhh! You know you really need
             to get yourself a pair of jammies.
                           
            Shrek sighs.

            "Royal Pain" by the Eels plays in the background as the
            title: "Shrek The Third" is superimposed.
                           
            A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek
            walks down the aisle of the church.
                           
            Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.
                           
            Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea
            what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who
            indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek
            starts to knight the knight.
                           
                            SHREK
             I knight thee...
                           
            Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.
                           
                            SHREK
             He-he. Ooh.
                           
            The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked.

            EXT. BOAT DOCKS - DAY
                           
            Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal
            Navy.
                           
            Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the
            boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws
            the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the
            side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.
                           
            Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their
            heads as they leave.

            INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
                           
            Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around
            Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of
            them.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Well, since you're filling in for
             one, you might as well look like a
             real King. Can somebody come in
             here and work on Shrek please?
                           
            Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow.
                           
                            RAUL
                            (AHEM)
             I will see what I can do.
                           
            He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.
                           
            Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.
                           
            A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip
            cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He
            turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind
            away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.
                           
            We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into
            frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.
                           
            Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.
                           
                            FIONA

            Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to
            reveal that the lips are Shrek's.
                           
            A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps
            snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and
            tighten up the zipper all the way.
                           
            A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn,
            Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!
                           
            A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is
            tightened.
                           
            A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's
            belt. A mole is placed on his cheek.
                           
                           
            INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER
                           
            REVEAL: Shrek and Fiona standing awkwardly in outrageous
            Renaissance outfits.
                           
            Donkey gasps.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Oh!
                           
            Puss rolls his eyes.
                           
                            PUSS
             Yeah, wow.
                           
            Fiona is uncomfortable.
                           
                            FIONA
             Uh, is this really necessary?
                           
                            RAUL
                            (TO SHREK)
             Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona.
                           
                            SHREK

                            RAUL

                            PUSS
             Okay peoples! This isn't a
             rehearsal. Let's see some hustle.

            Off-screen, the Master of Ceremonies announces the couples
            arriving at the party.
                           
            Fiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood.
                           
                            SHREK
             I don't know how much longer I can
             keep this up Fiona.
                           
                            FIONA
             I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please
             just try to grin and bear it? It's
             just until Dad gets better.
                           
            Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh.
                           
                            FIONA
             Shrek?
                           
                            SHREK
             Yeah.
                           
                            FIONA
             You look handsome.
                           
                            SHREK
             Ah. Come here, you.
                           
            She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles
            back.
                           
            Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but
            their bulky outfits prevent it.
                           
            Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air.
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh, my butt is itching up a storm
             and I can't reach it in this monkey
             suit!
                           
            Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail.
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh.

             Hey you. Come here!
                           
            A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek.
                           
                            SHREK

            INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
                           
            The announcer introduces Shrek and Fiona.
                           
             MASTER OF CEREMONIES
             Ladies and gentlemen, Princess
             Fiona and Sir Shrek!
                           
            The audience claps. The curtain starts to open.
            Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt.
                           
                            SHREK
             You've done it. Oh, a little over
             to the left, yeah. That's great.
                           
                            FIONA
             Uh Shrek?
                           
            Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd
            looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention.
                           
                            SHREK
             Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh
             yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!
             Oh that's good!
                           
                            FIONA
             Shrek...
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You
             got it. You're on it. That's
             great!
                           
                            FIONA
             SHREK!
                           
            Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both
            freeze. Shrek laughs nervously.
                           
            Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the
            eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Ow!! My eye! My eye!

            As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.
                           
                            WOMAN
             What are you doing?
                           
            The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a
            guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the
            axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The
            axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona
            maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the
            vase which causes Fiona to fall over.
                           
            Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding
            Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his
            pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.
                           
                            SHREK
             Fiona!
                           
            He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the
            stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying
            through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,
            trapping him.
                           
                            FIDDLESWORTH
             Uhhh...
                            (WIMPER)
                           
            Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor.
                           
                            SHREK
             Are you okay?
                           
                            FIONA
             Yeah. I'm fine.
                           
            Fiona's eyes suddenly widen.
                           
            Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter
            carrying flaming skewers.
                           
                            FIDDLESWORTH
             Ahhhh!
                           
            The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame
            with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and
            land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of
            the skewers out and takes a bite.
                           
                            DONKEY

            The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden
            ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half.
                           
            The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables
            slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide.
                           
            CRASH! BANG!
                           
             CUT TO BLACK:
                           
                           
            INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                           
            The door to Fiona's room flies open.
                           
                            SHREK
             That's it! We're leaving!
                           
            Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.
                           
                            FIONA
             Honey, please calm down...
                           
            Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.
                           
                            SHREK
             Calm down? Who do you think we're
             kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut
             out for this, Fiona and I never
             will be.
                           
            Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings
            his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to
            Donkey.
                           
                            DONKEY
             I think that went pretty well.
                           
            Shrek startles.
                           
                            SHREK
             Donkey!
                           
            Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Aww, come on now Shrek!
                           
            Shrek slams the door shut.
                           
            Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on
            his pillow.

                            PUSS
             Some people just don't understand
             boundaries.
                           
            Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him
            outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the
            ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the
            blinds.
                           
            Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries
            to calm him down.
                           
                            FIONA
             Just think... a couple more days,
             and we'll be back home in our
             vermin-filled shack, strewn with
             fungus, filled with the rotting
             stench of mud and neglect.
                           
            This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath
            and exhales. He smiles.
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
                           
                            FIONA
             And, uh... maybe even the pitter-
             patter of little feet on the
             floor...?
                           
                            SHREK
                            (LAUGHS)
             That's right. The swamp rats will
             be spawning.
                           
                            FIONA
             Uh, no... you know, what I was
             thinking of is a little bit bigger
             than a swamp rat.

             No, Shrek. Um... what if -
                            THEORETICALLY -

                            (NERVOUS LAUGH)
                           
            Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed.
                           
            He slowly emerges from behind the bed.
                           
                            SHREK
             Honey? Let's try and be rational
             about this. Have you seen a baby
             lately? They just eat and poop and
             they cry and then they cry when
             they poop and they poop when they
             cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.
             They extra cry and they extra poop.
                           
                            FIONA
             Shrek.
                           
            She grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes.
                           
                            FIONA
             Don't you ever think about having a
             family?
                           
            Shrek takes her hand.
                           
                            SHREK
             Right now, you're my family.
                           
            There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open,
            revealing a Royal Page.
                           
            Shrek springs up.
                           
                            SHREK
             Well, somebody better be dying.

            The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's
            bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.
                           
                            KING HAROLD
             I'm dying.
                           
            The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.
            Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen
            comes to the King's aid and he settles down.

             Don't forget to pay the gardener,
             Lillian.
                           
            The Queen is used to these kind of non-sequiturs.

             Of course darling.
                           
            The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.
                           
                            KING HAROLD

             I know I've made many mistakes with
             you.

             It's okay.

             But your love for Shrek has taught
             me so much.
                           
            Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek.
                           
                            KING HAROLD
             My dear boy, I am proud to call you
             my son.

            Shrek smiles.
                           
                            KING HAROLD
             Now, there is a matter of business
             to attend tooo...
                           
            The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops.
            They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat.
                           
                            PUSS

            Fiona starts crying. The King suddenly wakes up, coughing.

                            KING HAROLD
             Shrek, please come hither.
                           
            Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King.
                           
                            SHREK
             Yeah, Dad?
                           
                            KING HAROLD
             This Kingdom needs a new king. You
             and Fiona are next in line for the
             throne.
                           
                            SHREK
             Ooo. Next in line. Now you see
             Dad, that's why people love you.
             Even on your deathbed you're still
             making jokes.
                           
            The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in
            closer.
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?
             I don't think that's such a good
             idea. There's got to be somebody
             else. Anybody?

            Shrek leans in closer after each "is," waiting in
            anticipation. The King starts to hyperventilate.

            The King is dead. A fly comes out of his mouth and flies
            away.
                           
            Puss starts to take his hat off. The fly buzzes into frame.
            A tongue catches it. Puss puts his hat back on.

            He succumbs. The King really is dead now.

            Puss takes his hat off.
                           
            Fiona starts to cry and hugs Shrek. The weight of the King's
            request hits Shrek. He is in a state of shock.
                           
            We hold a moment on the Queen, Shrek, Fiona, Puss and Donkey
            to let the King's passing sink in.

            the shops on Rodeo Drive.

            Close on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen,
            and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered
            for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box ("Ye Olde
            Footlocker") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out
            into the water.
                           
            An overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily
            pads. The camera tilts up to reveal a frog choir, singing
            "Live and Let Die." The Princesses, Donkey, Puss and the
            Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly.
                           
            Shrek puts his arm around Fiona.
                           
            The funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse.
            Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen
            sadly gazes at the pond.

            The camera pulls back to reveal a cloaked figure, on
            horseback, overlooking the funeral. The figure removes his
            hood to reveal Prince Charming. He gives a smug smile, and
            rides off.

            Smoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the
            top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns
            and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans
            over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a
            microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing
            "I've Never Been To Me" by Nancy Wilson.
                           
            The bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two
            pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master
            takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch
            of empty beer mugs.
                           
            Prince Charming enters the bar.
                           
            A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval
            mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and
            the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming.
                           
            Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera
            adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the
            Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes
            notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding
            Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves
            glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks
            by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)
            playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and
            the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck.
            Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the
            bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool,
            and sits.
                           
            Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He
            clears his throat.

            Mabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster
            with a smiling beer wench.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly
             stepsister I'll never know.
                           
            He winks at her. She glares at him.

            She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel.

            Prince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons.

            Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The
            singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool
            cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug.

            Prince Charming grows nervous.
                           
            The Villains all approach Prince Charming.
                           
            From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his
            shoulders and pins him on top of the bar.

            ducks out of the way of a flying liquor bottle. He smiles
            nervously and lifts his fruity, Fuzzy Navel to drink.

            out a soft wail.
                           
                            DONKEY
             I know, I know... I don't want to
             leave you either baby, but you know
             how Shrek is. The dude's lost
             without me.
                           
            She gives him an understanding smile.
                           
                            DONKEY
             But don't worry. I'll send you
             airmail kisses everyday!
                           
            He blows her a kiss and she catches it. He looks down at his
            children, holding back tears.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Alright, be strong babies! Be
             strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you
             listen to Mama, alright? And
             Bananas, no more roastin'
             marshmallows on your sister's head.

            Bananas lets out a fiery sneeze.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Ah, that's my special boy. Oh,
             come over here, all of you. Give
             your Daddy a big hug!
                           
            The baby Dronkeys fly around their Daddy.
                           
            The Dronkey that Fiona is holding flies off to join Donkey
            and the others.
                           
            Fiona nervously takes in a breath.
                           
                            FIONA
             Shrek, maybe you should just stay
             and be King.
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could
             ever run a kingdom. That's why your
             cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.
                           
                            FIONA
             It's not that. No. It's, you
             see...
                           
                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             And if he gives me any trouble,
             I've always got persuasion and
             reason.
             (holds up his right fist)
             Here's persuasion,
             (holds up his left fist)
             and here's reason.
                           
            Shrek chuckles. Fiona gives him a look. Shrek reassures her.
                           
                            SHREK
             Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you
             and me and our swamp.

             me.
                           
            The ship's fog horn sounds.

             It will be. I promise. I love
             you.
                           
            He kisses her and joins Puss and Donkey on the boat.
                           
            He title proudly reads: H.R.M CRUSHING RESPONSIBILITY II
                           
            The boat sets sail. The Dronkeys spell out "We Love You
            Daddy" with smoke in the sky.

             That's lovely.
                           
            Donkey waves to his kids, sobs.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Bye bye babies!
                           
            Fiona runs after the boat.
                           
                            FIONA
             Shrek!
                           
            Shrek leans against the rail, calling out to her.
                           
                            SHREK
             Yeah?
                           
                            FIONA
             Wait!
                           
                            SHREK
             What is it?
                           
            She smiles and takes a deep breath.
                           
                            FIONA
             I'm, I'm-
                           
            The Ship Captain blows a fog horn and cuts her off. Shrek
            smiles back at her.
                           
                            SHREK

            The Ship Captain starts to blow again. Shrek grabs the horn
            and throws it overboard.
                           
                            SHREK
             You're what?!
                           
                            FIONA
             I said I'm pregnant!
                           
            The Fairy-tale Creatures behind Fiona cheer.

             Uh... what was that?
                           
                            FIONA
             You're going to be a father!

             That's great.
                           
                            FIONA
             Really? I'm glad you think so! I
             love you.
                           
            Shrek smiles back at Fiona.
                           
                            SHREK
             Yeah...
                            (NERVOUS LAUGH)
             Me too... you...
                           
            Fiona smiles as the Queen places a hand on her shoulder.
                           
            Overjoyed at the news, Donkey pops up onto the railing.

            The fog horn blasts again as the boat disappears into the
            fog.

            EXT. BOAT CABIN - NIGHT
                           
            The boat travels along in the open sea. Shrek is fast asleep
            as the boat travels through an estuary and beaches itself.
                           
            Shrek wakes up. He opens the cabin door.
                           
                            SHREK
             Ahhh. Home.
                           
            He smiles to himself. The boat has beached itself right
            outside of Shrek's swamp house.
                           
            He leaps off the boat.
                           
                            SHREK
             Woohoo!
                           
                           
            EXT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                           
            Shrek takes a deep breath of swamp air.
                           
                            SHREK
             Ahh.
                           
            He skips and dances happily toward his house.

            He sashays through the front door with his eyes closed,
            presenting himself.
                           
                            SHREK

            After a moment of silence, he opens his eyes, realizing that
            Fiona is not there.
                           
                            SHREK
             Fiona?
                           
            He looks around the room, puzzled. The door slams closed
            behind him.

            A baby carriage rolls slowly into frame behind him. He turns
            slowly and sees the baby carriage covered with a blanket.
            Shrek removes the blanket, revealing a baby ogre, smiling
            innocently at him.
                           
                            SHREK
             Huh? Oh no.
                           
            The baby burps.
                           
                            SHREK
                            (AMUSED)
             Better out than in, I always say.
             Ha ha!
                           
                            OGRE BABY
             Hiccup!
                           
            This time the baby's burp turns into projectile vomit aimed
            directly at Shrek. Shrek puts his hand up to block the
            vomit, but to no avail. The baby continues to vomit, but
            eventually stops after completely soiling himself and Shrek.
            The baby looks like it's about to cry. Shrek raises his
            hands.
                           
                            SHREK
             No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha.
             It's okay. It's gonna be alright.
                           
            Shrek picks the baby up, smiling at it cautiously. He holds
            it awkwardly for a few seconds, then looks up and realizes
            that his house is filled with babies.
                           
                            OGRE BABY
             Da-Da!
                           
            Babies roll around his living room, tearing the fabric off
            his chair. The chair reclines, catapulting one of the babies
            onto Shrek's head. A standing lamp with a baby on top falls,
            and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the
            tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.
            Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One
            of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs
            over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a
            baby out of the cauldron.
                           
                            SHREK
             Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya?
             No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.
                           
            Shrek panics. A baby is knocking glass jars off the shelf.
            Shrek catches him before he crawls off of it. Shrek runs
            through the room picking up babies.

            After he has collected as many babies as he can, Shrek slides
            open the curtain to his bedroom.
                           
                            SHREK
             Huh?
                           
            He sees a baby sitting in his bed, smiling up at him. The
            baby shrugs.
                           
                            OGRE BABY
             Bubabatoo?
                           
            Suddenly, Shrek hears a loud rumble. He turns around.
            Babies start pouring out of the window and the fireplace.
            First there is one, then two, then thirty more follow.
            Hundreds of them start piling in.
                           
            Shrek makes a run for the doorway, but no matter how hard he
            runs, the doorway keeps getting farther and farther away! He
            keeps trying, hundreds of babies trailing behind.

            Finally, Shrek reaches the door and opens it. He slams it
            shut behind him and closes his eyes. Everything is quiet.
            He opens his eyes and finds himself on stage in front of his
            high school.
                           
            Shrek looks up to find a graduation cap on his head. The
            audience is full of ogre babies laughing at him. The camera
            pulls back to reveal Shrek standing at the podium, naked.

            Shrek's eyes pop open, he sits upright and tries to compose
            himself.
                           
                            SHREK

             up!
                           
            Donkey and Puss turn around, but they both have baby-ogre
            faces! Donkey makes a baby noise. As the camera zooms in,
            Donkey's eyes glow red and his teeth become sharp and pointy.

            A fog horn blows. Shrek bolts upright again. Donkey and
            Puss wake up.

            He breaths heavily, trying to compose himself.

            Donkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to
            the ship's railing.

             Allow me to explain. You see, when
             a man has certain feelings for a
             woman, a powerful urge sweeps over
             him...

            Shrek walks away.
                           
            Donkey leans over to Puss.

             me feel better?
                           
            Shrek slumps against the rail. Puss hops up on the railing
            and whispers into Shrek's other ear.
                           
                            PUSS

             weeks of nothing but fishing.
                           
            Puss makes a "let's go fishing" gesture by casting an
            imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to
            whisper in Shrek's other ear.

            In the distance, Shrek spots A BOLD KNIGHT atop his steed.
            He looks very impressive as he rears up ready to charge.
                           
            Shrek, Donkey and Puss arrive to see the beginning of the
            charge. It's an exciting back and forth.

            The opponent's eyes widen in fear.
                           
            The lance hits, and the opponent flies through the air and
            lands in front of Shrek, Puss and Donkey.
                           
            Shrek looks back at the victorious Knight. He removes his
            helmet revealing a strong handsome face. The Knight enjoys
            his victory.

             other guys... at whatever it is
             they're doing.

                            PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
             This is indeed all a bit
             unorthodox.
                           
            Without breaking stride, Shrek grabs Principal Pynchley's
            megaphone.

            The students all point... to the basketball hoop, where Artie
            hangs helplessly. Shrek, Donkey and Puss turn and look up
            and see the freshly wedgied student. The students laugh.
                           
            In the front row, Lancelot bumps fists with Bohort.

            Lance points to the D&D nerds. They are beside themselves
            with nasal laughter. Nosebleed boy starts bleeding again.
                           
            Shrek reaches up and pulls Artie down to eye level.

             My good people, I think there's a
             lesson here for all of us. Maybe
             the next time you're about to dunk
             a kid's head in a chamber pot,
             you'll stop and think, hey, maybe
             this guy has feelings. Maybe I
             should cut him some slack. Because
             maybe, just maybe... this guy's
             gonna turn out to be, uh...I
             dunno...a King! And maybe his
             first royal decree will be to
             banish everyone who ever picked on
             him -- that's right, I'm looking at
             you, jousting team.

            towards him.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You! You can't lie. So tell me
             puppet... Where is Shrek?!

            Prince Charming gets in Pinocchio's face.

             You're telling me you don't know

            Pinocchio is still a little nervous.
                           
                            PINOCCHIO
             It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume
             that I couldn't exactly not say
             that is or isn't almost partially
             incorrect.
                           
            Pinocchio thinks he has the upper hand.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             So you do know where he is!
                           
                            PINOCCHIO
             On the contrary, I'm possibly more
             or less, not definitely rejecting
             the idea, that in no way, with any
             amount of uncertainty that...

             If that indeed wasn't where he
             isn't. Even if he wasn't not where
             I knew he was could mean that I
             wouldn't completely not know where
             he wasn't.
                           
            Gingerbread Man continues to sing his "Lollipop Song."

             bring back the next heir! Oh!
                           
            The pig realizes his admission and immediately covers his
            mouth. Pinocchio laughs nervously.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING

            direction of his school. Shrek works his way into the cabin
            and gains control of the wheel. The drunken Ship Captain
            slides by.

            Shrek turns the wheel the other way.

             What are you doing?!
                           
            The boat veers again, heading back toward Far Far Away.
            Artie falls to the ground and slides to the back of the boat.
                           
            A shuffle board stick slides next to Artie. He grabs it.

             What does it look like?!
                           
            He jams it in the boat's wheel. The boat lurches.

            He swings the boat back in the other direction. Shrek rises
            up and grabs the wheel and turns it.
                           
                            SHREK
             This really isn't up to you!
                           
            Artie falls underneath the wheel. He stands up shoving the
            wheel back the other way.
                           
                            ARTIE

             being King!
                           
                            SHREK
             You'll learn on the job!
                           
            Donkey and Puss roll across the deck.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Whoaaa!
                           
            Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around. Artie yanks the
            wheel. They wrestle for control.
                           
                            ARTIE
             Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm
             going back!
                           
                            SHREK
             Back to what? Being a loser?!
                           
            As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone
            too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to
            yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the
            decking.

             Now look what you did!
                           
                            ARTIE
             Look what I did? Who's holding the
             wheel chief?
                           
            Donkey climbs up onto the railing. He is seasick and is
            about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead.

            Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer
            the ship clear of the rocks.

            The camera pans past the boat. Off-screen we hear the boat
            crash into the rocks.

            Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach.
            He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek
            drops Puss and Donkey.
                           
            Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur
            puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame.
                           
                            PUSS
             How humiliating...
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh, nice going, Your Highness.
                           
                            ARTIE
             Oh, so now it's "Your highness?"
             What happened to "loser?" Huh?
                           
                            SHREK
             Hey, if you think this is getting
             you out of anything, well it isn't.
             We're heading back to Far Far Away
             one way or another, and you're
             gonna be a father!
                           
            Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek
            uncomfortably.
                           
                            ARTIE

            Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a
            path into the woods.
                           
                            SHREK
             Where do you think you're going?

            Artie keeps climbing.
                           
                            PUSS
             Uh boss, I don't think he's coming
             back and maybe it's for the best.
             He is not exactly king material.
                           
            Shrek looks towards Artie.
                           
                            DONKEY

             to be King?
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh c'mon, now why would I do that?
             Besides, he'll be ten times better
             at it than me.
                           
            Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then

            Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood.

             What about this?
                           
            Donkey shakes his head in disgust.

            Shrek tosses the log.
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.
                            (LAUGHS)
             Still...
                           
            Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie.

            Artie marches up the mountain trail.
                           
            Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic
            with the kid. He catches up to Artie.
                           
                            SHREK
             Listen Artie...
                           
            Artie looks back over his shoulder. He sees Shrek and just
            keeps going.
                           
                            SHREK (CONT'D)
             If you think this whole mad scene
             ain't dope, I feel you dude. I
             mean, I'm not trying to get up in
             your grill or raise your roof or
             whatever, but what I am screaming
             is, yo, check out this kazing
             thazing bazaby.
                           
            Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices a
            cottage in the distance and heads toward it.

             didn't, you know, you're gettin' on
             my last nerve. And then I'll know
             it's... then I'll know it's whack--
                           
            Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch,
            striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running.

            A boiling soup pot sits over a fire in front of a small
            shack. Artie charges though, pounding desperately on the
            door.

            Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that
            is hung on the door. A bright, colorful image of an old
            wizard's head is projected out. Donkey is terrified.

            With a "FZZZZT" and a "BLOOP", the image disappears.
                           
            The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out.

             Uh, technically I was merely a
             victim of a level three fatigue,
             and at the request of my therapist
             and the school authorities, I have
             retired to the tranquility of

            Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment.
                           
                           
                           
                            MERLIN
             Now, can I interest anyone in a
             snack or beverage?
                           
                            SHREK
             Uh, no.
                           
            Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Sure you don't wanna try my famous
             rock au-gratin?
                           
            Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly. His gums are bleeding
            from eating rocks.
                           
                            MERLIN
             It's organic!
                           
            They both stare at him uncomfortably.

                            SHREK
             Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of
             people counting on you so don't try
             and weasel out of it.

             destructive rage spiral it would be

             Ahhhhhhhhhh!
                           
            Shrek grabs Merlin's mouth and closes it.

            A fire blazes.
                           
            Merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Now all of you, look into the "Fire

             Yah! Ha!

            He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e.
            Rorschach inkblots).
                           
            Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire.
                           
                            DONKEY

             Okay. Monster, go for it.
                           
            Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare
            begins to take shape in the smoke. He blows the image away.
            He covers his fear and changes the subject.

            Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head.

             You're lame! Now just go for it.
                           
            He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it.
                           
                            ARTIE
             Okay. There's a baby bird and a
             father bird sitting in a nest.
                           
            Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to
            change as he stays focused.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!

             Wait, the dad just flew away. Why
             did he leave the little bird all
             alone?
                           
            Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more
            worked up.
                           
                            ARTIE
             It's trying to fly, but it doesn't
             know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
                           
            Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts
            away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him,
            stunned.
                           
                            MERLIN

             Whoa.
                           
            Merlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie.

            Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie.
            Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists.

            Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are
            For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device
            drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the
            shack where Merlin peeks out.

            He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's
            quiet again.

             He tried to eat me.
                           
            Artie looks at Shrek.

             Now, I guess I should have seen it
             coming. He used to give me a bath
             in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
             with an apple in my mouth.

             You know, it may be hard to believe
             what with my obvious charm and good

             that I was a monster. And for a
             long time, I believed them.

            Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.

            The Princesses, Fiona and the Queen are surrounded by
            darkness as they tiptoe down the steps and into the catacombs
            below the castle.
                           
            They round a corner and step onto a ledge with Fiona leading
            the way, holding a torch.

            Fiona tries to keep her frustration in check.

                            SNOW WHITE
             Well maybe it just bothers you that
             I was voted fairest in the land.

            Snow White and Rapunzel share an indignant look.
                           
            Fiona travels deeper into the catacombs. The other
            Princesses follow.
                           
                            SNOW WHITE
             So I guess the plan is we just
             wander aimlessly in this stink hole
             until we rot.
                           
                            FIONA
             No, we're gonna get inside and find
             out what Charming's up to.

            They peer around a corner and see the construction of an
            outdoor theater is underway. Two stagehands walk by carrying
            a large dragon set piece. Evil dwarves are busy painting the
            set. The finishing touches are put on the stage tower.
                           
            The Princesses hug the wall as a group of guards march by.
                           
            Rapunzel takes off in the other direction, and signals the
            Princesses to follow her.

            Fiona and the Princesses race after Rapunzel. They spot her
            sprinting into the castle and follow her. They burst through
            the doors and see Prince Charming holding Rapunzel by the
            arm.

            Shrek startles awake. He sits up and scratches his head,

            Behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch. Suddenly,
            the tree branch that was holding the bird flicks it off.
                           
            Shrek senses the movement behind him and turns around to find
            everything is normal. He turns back around to wake up
            everyone.

            The Evil Trees continue to advance. A piano is heard. The
            trees part and Hook is revealed to be playing the piano.
                           
            The music builds to a dramatic finale. Captain Hook turns
            away from his keys and faces them.

            The pirates close in. Shrek grabs one and throws him to the
            side.
                           
            One pirate raises his sword and prepares to swing at Artie.

            happily playing along with Captain Hook. He notices and
            rudely elbows Merlin out of the way.
                           
            A pirate runs at Shrek, only to be tripped by Artie. The

            A wooden board is thrown on a stump, creating a makeshift
            "plank." The pirates back Shrek onto the plank.
                           
            Several pirates with swords force Shrek onto the plank. He
            is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a
            waiting treasure chest below. Several pirates try to shut the
            lid on him.

            The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie. Artie
            starts to panic. Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut
            through the netting.
                           
            The cannon fuse is lit.

             Help!
             Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75.
                           
                           
                           
            Shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan. He
            grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest.
            He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and
            catapults himself over to the cannon. At the last second,
            Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction.
            The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it
            into pieces.
                           
            Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that
            holds Donkey, Puss and Artie. The Evil Trees and Pirates
            take off running.
                           
            Captain Hook turns and sees his army running off. He shakes
            his hook in the air.
                           
                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Ya cowards!
                           
                            SHREK
             What has Charming done with Fiona?
                           
                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             She's gonna get what's coming to
             her.
                           
            He raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an
            Evil Tree's branch and is dragged away with the rest of the
            Villains.
                           
                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             Ahhh.
                            (YELLING BACK)
             And there ain't nothing you can do
             to stop him!
                           
            TIGHT ON SHREK, filled with worry. Nothing else matters to
            him now.
                           
            Artie, Puss, and Donkey run over to Shrek.
                           
                            PUSS
             We've got to save her!
                           
                            DONKEY
             But she's so far far away!
                           
            Shrek thinks for a moment.
                           
                            SHREK
             Get yourself back to
             Worcestershire, kid.

                            ARTIE
             No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've
             got an idea.
                           
                           
            EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP - CONTINUOUS
                           
            Merlin is sitting cross-legged, deep in meditation. Artie
            approaches him.
                           
                            MERLIN
                            (CHANTING)
             I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz,
             buzz...
                           
                            ARTIE
             Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to
             get them...I mean, us, back to Far
             Far Away.
                           
            Merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his
            eye at Artie.
                           
                            MERLIN
                            (GETTING UP)
             Forget it. I don't have that kind
             of magic in me anymore, kid. How
             about a hug instead? Hmm? That's
             the best kind of magic.
                           
            Artie tries a new approach.
                           
                            ARTIE
             Mr. Merlin please. I know you can
                            DO IT-
                           
                            MERLIN
             I said, forget it!
                           
                            ARTIE
                            BUT-
                           
            Merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his
            breath.
                           
                            MERLIN (CONT'D)
             Mumble, grumble, interrupt my
             healing. Mumble, mumble.
                           
            Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts
            to sob. Merlin stops and turns around.

                            MERLIN
             Oh. What, what's with you?
                           
            Artie continues to cry.
                           
                            ARTIE
             It's just so hard. You know? They
             really need to get back `cause
             their kingdom's in trouble `cause
             there's a really bad man and it's
             just so hard...
                           
            Merlin is visibly uncomfortable.
                           
                            MERLIN
             C'mon, take it easy.
                           
            Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable.
                           
                            ARTIE
             No! I don't think you understand!
             There's a mean person doing mean
             things to good people-
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh, have a heart old man!
                           
            Artie grabs him, now desperate.
                           
                            ARTIE
             And they really need your help to
             get them back! So why won't you
             help them?
                           
                            MERLIN
             Oh.
                           
            Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line.
                           
            Merlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my
             things.
                           
            Merlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers.
            Shrek is impressed.
                           
                            ARTIE
             Piece of cake.

                            SHREK
             Well, well, well. You want some
             eggs with that ham?
                           
            Shrek smiles.
                           
            Merlin returns holding a spell book.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Now, I am a little rusty, so there
             could be some side effects.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Side effects!?
                           
                            MERLIN
             Don't worry, whatever it is, no
             matter how excruciatingly painful
             it may be, it'll wear off
             eventually... I think.
                           
            Merlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out
            his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Ah!
                           
                            MERLIN
             Oops.
                           
            Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Are you sure this is a good idea?
                           
                            SHREK
             Look, if Artie trusts him, that's
             good enough for me. Even if his
             robe doesn't quite cover his-
                           
                            MERLIN
             Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy
             zoom zoom. Let's help our friends
             get back, um... soon!
                           
            Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers. Shrek, Puss,
            Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Woah! It worked!

            They reappear and fall out of the sky and bounce through the
            canopy of a large apple tree. They ping-pong through the
            foliage and land in a heap at the base of the tree.

            Donkey adjusts himself, feeling hung over.

             Oh man, I haven't been on a trip
             like that since college.
                           
                            SHREK
             Donkey?

             (in Puss' body)
             What? Is there something in my
             teeth?
                           
            Donkey's eyes widen. He realizes his voice is coming out of
            Puss' body.
                           
                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Huh? What the?

             Oh no!
                           
            Donkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat. He looks down at
            Puss' boots. His tail begins to twitch.
                           
                            DONKEY

             I've been abracadabra'd into a

            Puss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in
            Puss' body).
                           
                            PUSS

             At least you don't look like some
             kind of bloated roadside piÔøΩata.
             You really should think about going
             on a diet!

             Yeah, and you should think about
             getting yourself a pair of pants!
             I feel all exposed and nasty.
                           
            Both Shrek and Artie stare at them. A strained smile pasted
            to their faces. They burst out laughing.
                           
            Donkey joins Puss, both of them scowling.
                           
                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Oh, so you two think this is funny?
                           
            Puss is fuming.
                           
            Shrek and Artie regain their composure.

             Don't be! You got us back kid.
                           
            Shrek motions to Far Far Away, just a few miles ahead of
            them. He turns back to Artie.
                           
            Artie smiles.
                           
            Donkey takes a few awkward steps in Puss' body.

                            PUSS
             Be very careful with those - HEE
             HAW!
                           
            Puss is shocked by this. He tries to recover.

            EXT. ENTRANCE TO FAR FAR AWAY - AFTERNOON
                           
            Shrek, Puss (in Donkey's body), and Artie rush past a welcome
            sign to the town that has been boarded over so it now reads
            "Go Go Away."
                           
            Donkey (in Puss' body) struggles to walk. His tender new
            feet hurt in their tiny boots.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Seriously man, you need some
             comfort inserts or arch supports or
             something.
             (noticing Rodeo Drive)
             Woah!
                           
            Inside the kingdom, Rodeo Drive is trashed. There is graffiti
            everywhere.
                           
            Suddenly a carriage driven by Evil Witches comes zooming down
            Rodeo Drive.
                           
                            EVIL WITCHES
             Woohoo!!
                           
            The carriage zips around a corner on two wheels. A drunken
            Evil Dwarf is almost hit by the carriage while crossing the
            street.
                           
            Shrek is shocked by what he sees.
                           
            A crash is heard off-screen.
                           
                            EVIL DWARF #1
             Hey... watch it I'm walking here...
             and I'm gonna keep going...
                           
            A large explosion is heard off-screen while Little Red Riding
            Hood pick pockets the Evil Dwarf.
                           
            A carriage wheel on fire rolls by a marionette theatre with
            Pinocchio dancing in it.

             Shrek!
                           
            Shrek and the rest rush over as the curtain starts to go down
            on Pinocchio. He presses his puppet hands against the glass.
                           
                            SHREK

             What's happened?
                           
                            PINOCCHIO
             Charming and the Villains have
             taken over everything! They
             attacked us but Fiona and the
             Princesses got away. And now she's-
                            -
                           
            The time has run out. The cheesy music stops as the curtain
            goes down.
                           
                            SHREK
             She's what?! She's what!?
                           
            Shrek looks at the marionette theatre and sees how much it
            costs per show.
                           
                            SHREK

                            DONKEY
             C'mon Puss, you heard the man, help
             a brother out.
                           
                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Do you see any pockets on me?

             Hold on a second.
                           
            Donkey (in Puss' body) removes his boot, he turns it over and
            a bag of money falls onto the ground.

             Aha!
                           
            Donkey (in Puss' body) tosses the money to Shrek.
                           
                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             I had no idea ...really ...I swear.
                           
            Shrek quickly dumps the change into the machine. The music
            starts and the curtain goes up again and Pinocchio dances.
                           
                            SHREK
             Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?
                           
                            PINOCCHIO
             Charming's got her locked away some
             place secret. You gotta find him!
             He's probably getting ready for the
                            SHOWWWW---
                           
            The curtain goes down again.
                           
                            SHREK
             Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What
             show?
                           
            Pinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points
            to a poster on the wall. Puss reads the poster out loud.
                           
                            PUSS

             Shrek's final performance.
                           
            The picture shows Charming, sword raised in the air, with his
            foot pinning Shrek, tongue sticking out of his mouth, to the
            ground.
                           
                            DONKEY
             (in Puss' body)
             Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us
             you were in a play.
                           
                            SHREK
             Well I guess I've been so busy I
             forgot to mention it!

             GUARD #1 (O.S.)
             It's the ogre! Get him!
                           
            Shrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal
            knights, armed and ready. They drive them back into the
            alley. Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward.
                           
                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.
                           
            He whips his head towards the oncoming guards. His eyes are
            large and sweet. His lips pout. The guards are momentarily
            hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're
            staring at a donkey.
                           
            The guards recoil.
                           
                            GUARD #2
             Ugh! Kill it!
                           
            Puss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats.
                           
            Artie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps
            forward, confronting the guards.
                           
                            ARTIE
             Look, don't you know who he thinks
             he is? How dare you?
                           
            Shrek picks up on his plan.
                           
                            SHREK
             Donkey, we're dealing with
             amateurs.
                           
            The guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the
            wall. Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the
            poster off the wall.
                           
                            ARTIE
             He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so
             sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
                           
                            SHREK
             I'm gonna lose it!
                           
                            ARTIE
             I assume you have everything ready
             for tonight! You did get the list
             for the dressing room?
                           
            Donkey marches in.

             Yeah, the breakfast croissants
             stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.
             Oh, and please tell me you at least
             have the saffron corn with the
             jalapeno honey butter cause our
             client cannot get into his proper
             emotional state without his
             jalapeno honey butter.
                           
                            SHREK

             Uh...Maybe they should talk to
             Nancy in Human Resources.
                           
            Shrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the
            castle.
                           
                            PUSS

            The guards look at each other nervously.

            A group of enchanted trees work on through their dance
            number.
                           
            Two dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth
            in the rear of the stage.
                           
            The camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to
            a Shrek stand in.

             With this sword, I do- No.
                           
            He starts the line over.

            Without looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who
            falls to the ground.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (TO HIMSELF) )
             Is that the right word? "Smote?"
             "Smooote." Is that even a word
             actually? Maybe I should just
             smite him.
                           
            Unseen stage hands drag the stand-in away.

            Stagehands shove another stand in onto the stage beside
            Prince Charming.

             Ooh!!!
                           
            Prince Charming does a quick mime of being afraid and
            chuckles.

            Without looking he stabs stand in #2. He falls to the ground.
            Prince Charming is still frustrated.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING

            He throws the sword to the ground and turns toward the
            dancing villains who are staring at him.

            INT. CHARMING'S DRESSING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
                           
            Prince Charming storms into his colossal gold leafed dressing
            room, its walls covered with posters of inspirational sayings
            and portraits of Prince Charming in different acting roles.
                           
            Slamming the door, he plops down in his throne chair in front
            of a dressing table and large 3-way mirror. A statuette of
            his mother is on the vanity. He looks at it intently.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Our happily ever after is nearly
             complete, mummy. And I assure you,
             the people of this kingdom will pay
             dearly for every second we've had
             to wait.
                           
                           
                           
            Charming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek
            standing in the doorway. Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along
            side him.
                           
            Prince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek.

             Break a leg. Or, on second
             thought, let me break it for you.
                           
            He walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his
            dressing table.
                           
            Prince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button
            under the counter.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Thank goodness you're here. I was
             beginning to think you might not
             make it back in... time.
                           
            Shrek picks him up by the front of his shirt and scowls.

                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Don't worry. She and the others
             are safe. For now.
                           
            Shrek strengthens his grip.
                           
            Suddenly, a group of guards burst into the room and quickly
            surround Shrek, Artie, Puss and Donkey.
                           
                            ARTIE
             Ow.
                           
            Prince Charming smiles.
                           
            Shrek looks around and realizes he's beat. He drops Charming
            with a thud.
                           
            Prince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround
            Shrek.
                           
            Prince Charming walks over to Artie. A smile grows across
            his face.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Let me guess... Arthur?
                           
            Artie looks indignant. He raises himself up.
                           
                            ARTIE
             It's Artie, actually.

             King of Far Far Away?
                           
            Laughing, Prince Charming draws his sword and holds it up to
            Artie's neck.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             How pathetic! Now, stand still so I
             won't make a mess.
                           
            Shrek steps in.
                           
                            SHREK
             Charming, stop! I'm here now, you
             got what you wanted. This isn't
             about him.
                           
            Artie is confused.

             Then who's it about? I'm supposed
             to be King, right?
                           
            Shrek hesitates and then gathers himself.
                           
                            SHREK
             You weren't really next in line for

                            ARTIE
             But you said the King asked for me
             personally.
                           
                            SHREK
             Not exactly.
                           
                            ARTIE
             What's that supposed to mean?
                           
                           
            Shrek becomes defensive.
                           
                            SHREK
             Look, I said whatever I had to say,
             alright! I wasn't right for the
             job, I just needed some fool to
             replace me, and you fit the bill.
             So just go!
                           
            Artie is stunned.
                           
                            ARTIE
             You were playing me the whole time.
                           
            Shrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more.

            Puss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in

            stares at Shrek one last time and heads out.
                           
            Shrek lowers his head in shame.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You really do have a way with

            Prince Charming smiles and the guards lead Shrek off.

            The scene cross-dissolves to Artie's back as he walks away

            storms away.

            Shrek's ankles and wrists are shackled. Shrek pulls on his
            chains. He sadly looks out the cell window.

            comes to the window of her prison cell. She stares

            Fiona looks out the cell window towards the castle in the
            distance. Behind her, Snow White paces around, complaining.

             Yeah, shut up.
                           
            Cinderella looks down at her reflection in the floor.

            Suddenly, the cell door flies open. Donkey and Puss (in each
            other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind
            them.

            Snow White points to another wall behind them.

             one more.
                           
            The Queen turns and sees the another wall barring their way.

            Fiona approaches her mother.
                           
            The Queen turns around, this time a little woozy, singing
            softly to herself.

            Snow thinks for a moment and then glances at the other
            Princesses. They nod.
                           
            Snow looks determined. She rips off a sleeve, revealing a

            The Dronkeys are held captive in the zoo. Donkey (in Puss'
            body) busts open their cage.

            As they enter the castle grounds, a group of guards runs
            towards them. Cinderella takes out a couple of them with her
            boomerang crystal slipper. Sleeping Beauty falls to the
            ground, asleep. The guards trip over her body.
                           
            Doris runs up to the foot of a canopy and takes a knee. The
            Princesses use Doris as a step to leap onto the canopy and
            over the castle wall.

            Donkey and Puss arrive (in each other's bodies). Donkey (in
            Puss' body) awkwardly tries to cut the glass open with his
            claws. Puss (in Donkey's body) intervenes, quickly bashing a
            hoof through the glass. They pull Gingerbread Man out of the

            "ooh" and "aah" as they approach the leg. The camera pans up
            to reveal Doris.

            There is a loud flash and a loud growling is piped through
            the sound system and flares go off as a trap door opens in
            the stage floor. Prince Charming hams it up for the
            audience, putting his hand to his ear.

            Rumplestiltskin cues Mabel.
                           
            Mabel is growling through a megaphone backstage.
                           
                            MABEL
             Roar! Roar!
                           
            Three Evil Witches turn a lever and an Evil Dwarf blows some
            steam with a billow.
                           
                           
            EXT. COURTYARD STAGE - CONTINUOUS
                           
            A large, imposing shadow grows onstage. The silhouette
            fades, revealing a shackled Shrek on stage. He pulls at his
            chains as he notes the audience and views the spectacle
            before him.
                           
                           
            INT. AUDIENCE - CONTINUOUS
                           
            A crowd of fans, with "SHREK" written on their stomachs,
            cheer. One of the fans is hit with an arrow. They promptly
            sit down.

            Pirates and Evil Knights dance in from the wings.

            Prince Charming takes a dramatic pause and sings in an ultra-
            high voice of a castrato.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
                            (SINGING)
             "Fear thee not Honey Lamb!
             I will slice this thing up like a
             HAM!"
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh boy.
                           
            Prince Charming relishes the moment, pulling out his sword
            and aiming it at Shrek's chest. Prince Charming's voice
            climbs even higher.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You are about to enter
             a world of pain with which you are

             "FamiliaAAAAAAR!"
                           
            He holds the last, highest note. Shrek winces. Goblets, eye
            glasses, a glass tiara and glass pearls all break in the
            audience.
                           
            Prince Charming smiles. Shrek looks at him with contempt.
                           
                            SHREK
             Well it can't be anymore painful
             than the lousy performance you're
             giving.
                           
            The audience laughs at Shrek's remark. Prince Charming is
            thrown by their reaction.
                           
            From a trap door underneath the stage Rumplestiltskin tries
            to help Prince Charming out by feeding him his next line.

            The audience laughs. Prince Charming gets in Shrek's face.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Be quiet!
                           
                            SHREK
             Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun
             with ya. That's actually a very
             nice leotard.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Thank you.

             Do they come in men's sizes?
                           
            The audience laughs again.
                           
                            HOOK
             He, he. Now that be funny.
                           
            The crowd laughs again. Shrek smiles, enjoying how he's
            screwing up the show. Prince Charming is furious.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             ENOUGH!
                           
            The crowd falls silent.
                           
            Prince Charming turns back to Shrek.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Now you'll finally know what it's
             like to have everything you've
             worked for, everything that's
             precious to you taken away.
                           
            Prince Charming raises his sword.
                           
             PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
             Now you'll know how I felt.
                           
            Suddenly a fireball hits the blade, melting it.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Ahhhhh!
                           
            Another huge fireball spreads across the sky as Dragon flies
            above the theater. The Dronkeys follow behind her.
                           
                            DRAGON

            The Three Pigs come running down the aisle.
                           
                            PIG #1
             Sausage Roll!!
                           
            The Three Pigs leap onto the stage, going into a drop and
            roll move to land in between Shrek and Prince Charming. They
            strike a fighting pose.
                           
            Pinocchio comes flying in on his strings, landing with a
            flurry of kung-fu hands.
                           
            The Wolf unzips the wolf costume, steps out and joins the
            others.

            Gingerbread Man pops up in the tower window, grabs Rapunzel's
            hair and swings down. Before he hits the ground, the end
            catches and he bounces like a bungee jumper. Her hair falls
            into a pile next to a very surprised Gingerbread Man.
                           
            Rapunzel screams. Her mousy brown hair crammed under a hair
            net. She runs off crying.
                           
            Prince Charming looks around, almost surrounded.
                           
            Suddenly a shadow falls over the crowd and they gasp. Dragon
            and the Dronkeys fly in and land on the stage.
                           
            Puss and Donkey leap off her back to the stage.

             ...Puss!
                           
            He claps his hooves on the stage.

            He carves a letter "D" on Pinocchio's bottom.

            The Queen head-butts through one of the backdrops, with
            Sleeping Beauty and Doris. Snow White flies in behind them
            with the help of her woodland creatures ("Crouching Tiger,
            Hidden Dragon" style). Cinderella runs on stage equipped with
            a mop as her weapon. Together, the Princesses strike fierce
            poses and stand next to Shrek.
                           
            The audience applauds.
                           
            Suddenly the front door of the "swamp house" set crashes to
            the floor, revealing Fiona.
                           
                            FIONA
             Hi honey! Sorry we're late. You
             okay?

             Awwwwwww!
                           
            The audience applauds. Shrek turns to Prince Charming
            raising his shackled wrists.
                           
                            SHREK
             So Charming, you wanna let me out
             of these so we can settle this ogre
             to man?
                           
            Prince Charming considers this for a second.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Oooh, that sounds fun. But I have
             a better idea!
                           
            Prince Charming strikes an imperious pose and claps his
            hands. Cyclops suddenly emerges from the trap door, knocking
            Puss and Donkey down. He approaches them menacingly.
                           
            The witches fly in and threaten the princesses with their
            brooms. The Evil Queen rises up behind the Queen and puts a
            knife to her throat.
                           
            The Evil Dwarves grab The Three Pigs. Gingerbread Man is
            suddenly surrounded by many Evil Knights. He poops out a gum-
            ball.
                           
            Dragon starts to move forward only to find herself surrounded
            by crossbows. A bunch of pirates grab Fiona and tie her up.

            Shrek struggles to free himself of the chains, but it's no
            use.
                           
            Prince Charming's eyes narrow.

            Prince Charming signals to the villains to attack Shrek. As
            the villains advance towards Shrek, a spotlight shines in
            their eyes, stopping them in their tracks.

             Artie?
                           
            Artie jumps from the spotlight.
                           
            Artie lands clumsily on a hanging cloud.
                           
            Artie leaps awkwardly from cloud to cloud. The audience
            stares in awe.
                           
            After one last leap, he swings down on the Cherub's cable,
            sending the little person up in the air.
                           
            Artie lands on the stage in between the Villains and Shrek.
            He stands facing the Villains.

             Who really thinks we need to settle
             things this way?
                           
            The Evil Knights think about it and raise their hands. The
            other Villains follow suit.
                           
                            ARTIE
             You're telling me you just want to
             be Villains your whole lives?
                           
            This gives the Villains pause.

             But we are Villains. It's the only
             thing we know.

             Didn't you ever wish you could be
             something else?
                           
            The Villains aren't convinced.
                           
                            EVIL TREE #2
             Well, it's easy for you to say.
             You're not some evil enchanted
             tree.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             You morons! Don't listen to him!

            Another Evil Tree covers Prince Charming's mouth and then

             What Steve's trying to say here is
             that it's hard to come by honest
             work when the whole world's against
             you.

             Okay, fair enough. You're right.
             I'm not a talking tree. But, ya
             know, a good friend of mine once
             told me that just because people
             treat you like a villain, or an
             ogre...
                           
            Artie shares a look with Shrek.

            The Fairy-tale Villains listen intently.

             ...it doesn't mean you are one.
                           
            The Evil Tree tightens his grip as Prince Charming struggles
            to break free.

             The thing that matters most is what
             you think of yourself.
                           
            Artie commands the stage.

             standing in your way ...is you.
                           
            Artie points at Rumplestiltskin directly in front of him.
            Rumplestiltskin is alarmed.
                           
                            RUMPLESTILTSKIN

             of you is standing in your own way!

             Oooooooh!
                           
            The Headless Horseman breaks through the crowd.
                           
                            HEADLESS HORSEMAN

            The Fairy-tale Villains and Creatures look at each other.
            The Evil Queen steps up.
                           
                            EVIL QUEEN
             I`d like to open up a spa in
             France.
                           
            The Villains nod in agreement.
                           
                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             I grow daffodils!
                           
            Complete silence as everyone stares at Hook.
                           
                            CAPTAIN HOOK
             And they're beautiful!
                           
            Captain Hook looks thoughtfully at his sword, then throws it
            down.

            The pirates throw theirs down, followed by the witches and
            Evil Knights. The evil knight holding Pinocchio is thinking
            about it when Pinocchio reaches over and takes the ax from
            him. The weapons pile up in the middle of the stage. Everyone
            else cheers and starts to mingle, introducing themselves and
            shaking hands.
                           
            Gingerbread Man high fives with an Evil Knight. Fiona is
            untied.
                           
            Mabel walks up to Doris and lightly punches her on the jaw.
            Doris returns the sign of affection by punching Mabel in the
            jaw, but a bit too hard, sending her falling to the ground.
                           
            Suddenly, Prince Charming kicks himself free of the Evil Tree
            and charges them. He grabs a sword from the discard pile and
            raises it up, his aim set at Artie.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Aaaahhhh!
                           
            Despite his fear, Artie faces Prince Charming bravely. As
            Prince Charming charges, Shrek finds the strength to break
            his chains. Just before Prince Charming strikes, a chain
            whips into frame, wrapping around the sword. Shrek pulls
            Prince Charming around in a circle, away from Artie. Furious,
            he charges Shrek and stabs him with the sword. Charming lets
            go and Shrek stumbles back with the weapon impaled in him,
            and falls to the floor, groaning.
                           
            Prince Charming beams, and laughs. He turns to the audience.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             A new era finally begins!
                           
            The audience cowers.
                           
            Shrek looks up smiling and nods at Fiona and Artie.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Now, all of you, bow before your
             king!
                           
            Shrek casually rises up behind him and clears his throat.
                           
                            SHREK
             Ah-hem.
                           
            Charming turns around. Shrek lifts his arm revealing that he
            was never really stabbed.
                           
                            SHREK (CONT'D)

            Charming is stunned.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             This was supposed to be my happily
             ever after.
                           
            Prince Charming is paralyzed. Shrek drops the sword and grabs
            him by the shirt-front, lifting him off of his feet.
                           
            He winces, but is still defiant.
                           
                            SHREK
             Well I guess you need to keep
             looking...
                           
            Shrek looks at Fiona and at his friends and smiles.
                           
                            SHREK
             ...cause I'm not giving up mine.
                           
            Shrek sets Prince Charming down and signals DRAGON. She
            casually tips the tower over with her tail. A shadow falls
            over Prince Charming. He turns and sees the tower falling
            toward him, his body perfectly framed up in the princesses's
            window.
                           
                            PRINCE CHARMING
             Mommy?
                           
            It crashes down and he's trapped inside.
                           
            As the dust clears, the crown rolls across the stage. Artie
            stops it with his foot and slowly picks it up.
                           
                            SHREK
             It's yours if you want it, you
             know, but this time it's your
             choice.
                           
            Artie considers it.
                           
            He looks at Shrek, who is smiling proudly at him.
                           
            Artie turns to the audience and holds out the crown to them.
            They cheer him.
                           
            Artie places the crown on his head. The crowd goes nuts. In
            the audience, Raul sobs with joy.
                           
                            ALL

            Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put
            Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and
            Puss, still in each other's bodies, watch as Artie gets
            carried away.
                           
            In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around
            confused, clutching his show ticket.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Uh, excuse me, that's my seat.
                           
            Suddenly he is thrown back against the front of the stage as
            Donkey and Puss confront him.
                           
                            PUSS
             (in Donkey's body)
             Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The
             time has come to rectify some
             wrongs!

             Please say you didn't.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Uh... alright, alright...look..
                           
            Merlin rubs his hands together.
                           
                            MERLIN
             You're gonna feel a little pinch,
             and possibly some lower intestinal
             discomfort, but this should do the
             trick.
                           
            Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the
            magic. He lets loose with a bright burst of magic. It takes a
            moment for Donkey and Puss to recover. They eye each other
            cautiously.
                           
                            PUSS
             Are you..?
                           
            Donkey lifts his hoof and inspects it carefully.

            Donkey and Puss give each other a big hug.

            The two of them turn and walk away together.
                           
            Merlin is behind them, smoking fingers and all. Suddenly his
            eyes grow wide.
                           
                            MERLIN
             Oops. Ah, never mind.
                           
            We see that Donkey still has Puss' tail and Puss had
            Donkey's. Merlin slips away.
                           
            Shrek and Fiona watch Artie in the distance.

             would have too.
                           
            Shrek smiles, and touches Fiona's belly.
                           
                            SHREK

            They kiss.
                           
            The camera pulls back to see everyone celebrating around
            Shrek and Fiona as they kiss.

            Shrek grabs a "gourd" bottle and creates an ogre shake out of
            slug juice, eye balls and worms. He walk over to join Fiona
            by the fire.
                           
                            SHREK
             Ah, finally.
                           
            Shrek gives Fiona the "gourd" bottle and she places a nipple
            on it. Two ogre babies crawl up onto Fiona's lap.
                           
                            OGRE BABIES
             Da da.
                           
            A third ogre baby appears at Shrek's feet. He bends down to
            pick him up.
                           
            One big happy family of five. Shrek laughs and gives the
            babies and Fiona a hug.
                           
            The front door opens up to reveal Puss and Donkey.
                           
                            DONKEY
             Hey! I smell Shrek Jr.
                           
            The Dronkeys come swarming in behind Donkey. Dragon peers in
            through the door.
                           
            Shrek with a safety pin in his mouth is doing his best at
            changing diapers. He twists the diaper around and the baby
            goes flying off screen and lands in a diaper that Fiona is
            holding. She smiles at Shrek.
                           
            The swamp house is overrun with Dronkeys, ogre babies and
            dirty diapers.
                           
            Puss sits next to an ogre baby that has a pacifier in his
            mouth. He takes the pacifier out of his mouth, shoves it in
            Puss' mouth and gives Puss a big hug. Another baby comes
            crawling into frame and starts to tug on Puss' tail. A tug
            of war ensues.
                           
            The ogre babies are bathing in a pot of water (a la a beat
            from the Nightmare scene). One of the babies farts in the
            water as Shrek comes in and scoops them up. Shrek laughs.

            A baby ogre pulls ear wax from Shrek's ear. The baby uses
            the wax to draw squiggly lines on a piece of paper.
                           
                            QUEEN

            The Queen is bouncing a baby ogre on her lap. The baby pukes
            and the Queen smiles.
                           
            There is a knock at the door. Donkey is laying on the floor
            holding a bottle with all four hooves, drinking the milk.
                           
            Shrek grabs the bottle out of Donkey's mouth.

            out of mud shot from geysers. Shrek slides down himself.
            The babies scramble out of the way as Shrek slides by,
            spraying mud everywhere.

            Shrek and Fiona are diapering two of the babies in perfect
            unison. They continue diapering, Fiona holds up the third
            baby and Shrek holds up an unhappy, diapered Puss.
                           
            Shrek grabs a gourd bottle off of a shelf. He tosses it to

            the gourd thrown to her, twirls it around (a la Tom Cruise in
            Cocktail), lifts up her leg where another baby is perched on
            her foot and puts the gourd in the baby's mouth.
                           
            Shrek is burping a baby over his shoulder. The baby burps.
            Fiona has a baby over her shoulder and the baby burps. A
            Dronkey sitting on a chair does a flame-belch and an ogre
            baby crawling by farts which causes a flame thrower effect
            into the fireplace.
                           
            Shrek and Fiona tuck all the babies into bed.

                           THE END</p>
        <p>I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new‚Ä¶ the best ‚Ä¶ the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine you are going to a friend‚Äôs house, so you text this: [ see you soon üôÇ ] seems normal, right? But what is you add the word semi to that colon? (Is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon üòâ ]THAT IS JUST SO CREEPY! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you can‚Äôt see anything else than him, so you can‚Äôt try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(I learned that word from the merchant of Venice(which is a good play(if you can understand it(I can cause I got a special book with all the words in readable English written on the side of the page(which is kinda funny because Shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and he‚Äôs racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (you‚Äôve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. ‚Äúcan i have some French fries?‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know why there called French fries when I‚Äôve never seen a French person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and cr√™pes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the PlayStation 2) And you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} ‚ÄúHahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehheheheheh‚Ä¶..heeeheehe..hehe‚Ä¶ sigh. I remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now I can give it to this NERD!! ‚Äù (yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? I think it might be like a Twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is doesn‚Äôt really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so I didn‚Äôt have to Google what a fat cake is (right now I am typing on my iPhone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i can‚Äôt get internet anyway (it‚Äôs actually a really funny story that i‚Äôll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend named Joe (an ACTUAL friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (don‚Äôt ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say ‚Äúwin a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bag*‚Äù(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: ‚Äúone of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we don‚Äôt want to get sued so we did this promotion thing‚Äù cool. Oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and that‚Äôs pretty much his life, he lives in Jamaica with Naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i don‚Äôt) but now i am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then i‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? WELL. i will steal something from that person but do it better. i will‚Ä¶ drum roll please ‚Ä¶ badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpow-crash! *a drum roll was just playing in the background* that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about. *scrolls up to see what he was writing about* oh yea! i will make my own FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK! what things do i like? instead of flaming it could be rainbow, instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook (not very creative, i know) but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook! to make life easier for you guys, instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly, i will take them out using my favourite numbers! so, section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite numbers! 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm tired. it is 10:41 and i am getting sleepy‚Ä¶ hey hey hey! an intruder! remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or something like that! with piplup and sunflora and chimchar! whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty keyboard! try it! i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard! (just in case you didn‚Äôt know, asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena, which is now shut down üò¶ ) what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely! i will type it out for you just in case one day they get rid of it. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. there u go. Goodbye. I‚Äôm back! i decided that i should tell you about fonts. i always used the same font for my whole life, called arial. the reason is probably because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order, and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down. only a few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind. i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity, and i finally got to‚Ä¶ are you ready ‚Ä¶ arial black. yep, that was my big SCROLLING ADVENTURE! just yesterday, i was typing something on google docs and i found the new best font : roboto. its great! i could choose from FIVE different thicknesses. isn‚Äôt that amazing? right now we are driving behind a really slow ‚Äúfarm plastics collection‚Äù semi. i think i know someone obsessed with pokemon, but i can‚Äôt tell you who it is. he keeps making pokepals references and stuff. wow! you are a very loyal reader! if you have REALLY made it this far then you‚Ä¶ get a gold star on your loyalty chart! good job! this is looking to be the longest text ever, considering that this was all written in one day. i don‚Äôt understand sandwiches. if you were to eat bread, mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting! you know all those fancy magazines/restaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels sprouts and all the old people say ‚Äúwow! that looks great!‚Äù and you think {bubble thing} ‚Äúit looks like the worst thing anyone could ever eat‚Äù and the you eat it and it tastes surprisingly‚Ä¶ WORSE than you imagined! gotta go‚Ä¶ im back! ive ive got stuff to say! your probably thinking‚Ä¶ HoW DoEs He HaVe So MuCh FrEe TiMe?!?! And the answer is‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt. that‚Äôs right. this isn‚Äôt just some SIDE project. i‚Äôve gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world record. for all i know, the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam (i don‚Äôt know why) is probably still adding to her posts. (i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and so is flaming chicken, so you will remember that now ) i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige (sounds catchy, huh?) . section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to use whatever font he wants to. [now, i know what your thinking reader, that has nothing to do with anything. but it will come in handy someday (maybe)] sam makes me feels sick! im offended! (probably because i‚Äôm jealous of how much is written on that website(i dont even know how to make a website)) I‚ÄôVE JUST BEEN READING THIS AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A CONSPIRACY! THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT, I AM WORKING FOR DOCTOR SUESS! YES! i will prove it to you. i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs and ham somehow! (why is he called doctor suess anyway? he‚Äôs not even a doctor *citation needed* and his books are kinda dumb! (funny considering i‚Äôm the one making that statement)) talking about eggs, aren‚Äôt eggs practically unborn chicken membrane? wouldn‚Äôt it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder (riotous robots reference (wow! serious compilation of alliteration dedication!)) and drinking your tae wit‚Äô da guv‚Äôna (england doesn‚Äôt even have a govna! *citation needed*)(i‚Äôm not even racist i‚Äôm just quoting an accent of a race) and you go to crack an egg for your brekkie and BOOM! and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you, picks up a knife and starts screaming ‚ÄúMAMA! MAMA!‚Äù you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry (a spoon) and poke the hideous beast. it is unaffected. luckily, the govener of Berwick-Upon-Tweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth! as you know, sugar is EXTREMELY poisonous to chicken embryos *citation needed* (no more citations!) and you are saved! i‚Äôm sick and tired of citations! i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook! section 12345679 (all the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the OCD people are twitching nervously in the corner) says that the king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a citation. great! now i feel like a free person! free i tell you, free! free from the prison cell i call the boundaries of untrue info. i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday, i should have great speech here it goes: Hello great people of [name of place]! i am here to tell you; I am going to make [name of place] great again! i am going to lower taxes, but increase happiness! i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for people with dogs, and do some renovations on peoples tents! yes, this truly is a new era, the era of Epicness And Coolness! {and so, his tale lived on forever, being passed on generation to generation, living vividly in the hearts of the people.(that last bit sounded like the ending of an Asterix comic.)} i will now PROVE that all these things can happen. the first thing i said was that i will make America (i know, i know, i gave it away and told you the name) place grape again. (yes, that is what i said, bear with me here) i hereby DECLARE that every piece of American soil must be covered in vineyards. someone told me i should do that. i think i heard it through the grapevine (bad jokethat nobody understands) the next step is to lower taxes and raise happiness. to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals, and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds. this in turn, raises happiness (for the kids and for the non-injured if you know what i mean). finally, i will buy dog sweaters (on sale at your local liquidation world!) and dog bowls (just use little human bowls maybe?) and last but not least i will do renos on peoples tents (send chip and joanna from Fixer Upper to all the camping places). and, since all i said was (partial) truth, it will be a great era. anyway, gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo. bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy! im back. i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun. we had bacon, ham and chicken but no turkey. its fall, but it‚Äôs ACTUALLY winter secretly. im watching a funny show. i‚Äôm back (even though i never said i was gone so you might be confused) hello loyal reader! if you have gotten this far without SKIMMING THROUGH then you are probably either lying, extremely bored (but not after reading this whole thing!) or VERY and i mean VERY dedicated. or all three. you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for money? i think its all a conspiracy! after all, uow can they afford those dogs, sharpies, cardboard and enough english education to write ‚Äúneed help‚Äù? back in the roman times, only the richest, most important people could get things like that! you know the new fad, ‚Äòblack surfboards‚Äô? (neither did i until 15 seconds ago) someone related to me thinks they look really cool, i think they are neat but SOMEONE also related to me thinks they are bad because they would get warped. someWHERE ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me, i was doing my normal thing, when BOOM! i started typing NONSENSE. so here it is, but be warned. its SCARILY NONSENSICAL.

I‚Äôm back! and i gotta new conspiracy for u! you know how EVERY child hates brussels sprouts! this is why i think so. Brussels sprouts were happily growing in their belgiumy home. everyone loved them! they were the chicken nuggets of the vegetable world. when suddenly‚Ä¶ DA DADA DA! Hitler comes to Belgium (dont read this if you don‚Äôt want to. hitler was happily taking over Austria and Poland when he then decided to take over France but France built a big wall thing to keep him out on the border between france and Germany so all Hitler did was go through Belgium to get to France and THAT is when our story is taking place.) and he makes all the brussles sprouts taste bad simply because he is near them! the Mulligan family is about to go to McRonalds and order 43 brussels sprouts (you would have to have been paying very close attention and know some math to understand that joke) and when they get them (after lots of quarrels with the manager (a bit of a parker square if you ask me (you probably don‚Äôt understand that either(if you want to feel like you know all these inside jokes, just look em up on the web! your sure to find the videos made by lumberpile(close enough))))) they taste so bad you throw up everywhere! Hitler may have caused WWII, but he also caused brussels sprouts to taste bad. so there you go. why do they always write WWII? (if you can‚Äôt tell, they always write double-u double-u eye eye) wouldn‚Äôt it be more accurate to write WW11 or WW2? If i keep writing at this rate, i‚Äôll beat the world record in no time! i might even print it all off and write a novel! too bad i probably don‚Äôt have any readers. hello there non existent reader! i hope you are having fun. and i hope you are not injured cuz of that whole ‚Äòno hospitals‚Äô conundrum. what else should i talk about? how bout Minecraft? just in case you don‚Äôt know, Minecraft is a fun game where you place blocks and stuff and you play with friends and most people who play it are like 10 years old but I not and i still have fun and you can‚Äôt judge me because I wanna be an engineer and if I wanna be an engineer then i should probably not waste my time playing games wow that went downhill from benefitting me really quickly. Anyway, I prefer the Redstone side of things (Redstone means wiring and stuff). I build stuff like 5 piston extenders and auto wall builders and calculators and computers (not those stupid computers that use command blocks (just in case you don‚Äôt know people, command blocks are like CHEATING THINGS and if I am talking about them i will probably not be happy)) and stuff cause i wanna be an inventor. I also do c++ and make things like search engines, text adventures and cookie clickers! My current BIGGEST project is 600 lines long and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a lot but it sure seems like it to me! (when I was typing in the word lines it auto corrected it to ‚Äòlies‚Äô) what‚Äôs with the whole naming appliances fad going on? (There isn‚Äôt really one) like that vacuum named ‚ÄòHenry‚Äô that I have. I have the box here and it says on it it can twist the top part which I never knew before! I just woke up but the anticipation of whether this whole Henry twist bit this is true is killing me and I think I might wake up just to see if its true. Nahhhhhhhhhhh!

I don‚Äôt even remember typing that! It‚Äôs so late a night my eyes are bulging out of my sockets because of the brightness on my phone! Now, I know what your thinking. TURN DOWN THE BRIGHTNESS, KING OF RAINBOWFLUFFYSHEEP! I will tell you why I shall not. Because on an iPhone 3 there is no easy access to get to your brightness. That‚Äôs for the WIMP. I‚Äôm hardcore. That‚Äôs why I Have typed a step by step tutorial on how to change the brightness on an iphone3 for you to read, in the comfort of your own home! (Or wherever your exciting life takes you) 1. Click the button on the top right of the phone to turn it on. 2. Swipe from the left to the right on the bottom of the screen. 3. Type in your password and the phone will unlock to the home screen. 4. Click on the Settings App (Your Almost There!) 5. Click on the ‚ÄòBrightness/Wallpaper‚Äô Tab. 6. GOOD JOB! ALL U HAVE TO DO IS SWIPE THE LITTLE BAR THINGY! that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt have THAT much time. I think. Halloo! I‚Äôm in London and I‚Äôm hangin out! Now I‚Äôm back though. This is extremely frightening. Whenever I type words then my phone reads it out to me. Strange.I just turned it off. Good thing too, since every time i heard it i turned around and punched the wall. Not out of fear for my life because of the impending imminent doom, but out of a pure piqued curiosity. Once you obliterate the wall once, every latter time you lose that satisfying crunch. One thing I have aspired to accomplish for a long time now is to make my own pun-themed conspiracy theory. Here goes: in section number 115132219018763992565095597973971522401 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook (i am very proud of that number by the way(*cue all geeks Laughing hysterically*)) STATES that the shearer of greatness (who‚Äôs that again?) has proof the the solvence of the illuminati (if you solve something, would it be called an act of solvence?) and forherbyshared proclaimences all right to own half of all southern states who share barbeque preferences (none([southern dialect] it ju bring a tear to ma eye knowin tha the founding fathers fought for freedum, an‚Äô fer unitee. Ye still the states Connor decide on a preferred bar bee q sawse :()) even if he does not want them. And now gentlemen and ladies, I will prove once and for all that the illuminati ‚Ä¶ Is real. Here goes: So, as everyone knows, the illuminati is represented by the pyramid with an eye in the centre. Do you think that it is merely a COINCIDENCE that the first letter in illuminati is i, and I is pronounced ‚Äòeye‚Äô? I THINK NOT! Let‚Äôs continue. What is the first thing you think of when you hear the word pyramid? Exactly! The first thing you think of is Egypt? Nooooo!! It‚Äôs that they‚Äôre big. Duh. So what is the first thing that you would say when seeing a pyramid? ‚ÄúWow that‚Äôs big?‚Äù No of course not random audience members indicated by the two line things! You would make the sounds of a mesmerised chimp, like ‚ÄúOooooh‚Äù and ‚ÄúAhhhhhhh‚Äù. And I know how these two things are connected! What temperature would it be in Egypt? Hot, that‚Äôs what! So hot that it feels like you are cooking a pan. Ahhhhhhhhhh pan, to be precise! And what county sounds like apan? Japan? Now is it just a COINCIDENCE that that Japanese word for big is ‚ÄòOo‚Äô? NOOO!!! These things are all connected, I just don‚Äôt fully know how yet. So, we know that the answer has something to do with being big, but what? for these kind of questions, you have to work backwards. I call this method, Reverse Solvency. Anyway, what did the rich (big) people do to the poor (not big) Egyptians around the time that the pyramids were built? Exactly! They sold em‚Äô that sounds like soldier! In French that‚Äôs gendarme! Gender! That‚Äôs what they are trying to tell us! It‚Äôs so obvious, in front of our very EYEs from the beginning! So, what gender is associated with being big! (This is gonna be slightly offensive) Males, obviously! (I‚Äôm sorry üò¶ *audience member calls out* don‚Äôt be sexist! Sorry, but you have to admit, men are usually fatter than women! ‚ÄúHey, now you‚Äôre being sexist to males! We have our rights, you know!!! Chauvinists! Communists! We are great! Who insists? Communists! We will rule with hate!!! ‚Äù ummm actually I was saying that men are fatter because back in the time of the PYRAMIDS if you were fat you were considered wealthy. ‚ÄúNow your sexist to us again! Feminists rule! Feminists are great! We are going to rule with hate!!‚Äù If you both want to rule with hate , just hate each other equally so this can be over with!!!! Thank you. Anyway, back to the conspiracy) Where were we? Oh yes. Men! What word has men in it? Fishermen, of course! Fishermen caught a lot of fish, and what did the Egyptians have a lot of? Gods! Fishermen used to go slow in boats, so we can remove the g forces, and we a left with ‚Äòod‚Äô. And where are the fishermen!?!? In the sea! The ‚Äòc‚Äô! And what kind of fish do they catch? That‚Äôs right, the ‚ÄòCod‚Äô! Now, we use are backwards method to come up with ‚ÄòDoc‚Äô. As in a doctor! What does a doctor do? Helps people who are sick! But do you know what the worst thing about doctors is? You still have the pay the doctors fee even if you are not sick! And mind you, the doctors fee is quite a large bill, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go to the doctor not even for a bee sting! Alas, This is as far as I have gotten. Can anyone help me? Um yes, you? ‚ÄúYes, I was just wondering what Big, men , ooo, not bees, Bills , and sickness have to so with the Illuminati! ‚Äù wait anonymous audience member say that again! ‚ÄúBut like, it was a lot of words‚Äù [the writer remembers that he is not allowed to copy and paste, so he skips the dramatic scene where one character says his sentence again while the Maine character says aha! I think I got it!] ‚Äúgot what? The flu?‚Äù Who the heck are you? And how did you get backstage? Security?!?! SECURITY!!!!! ‚Äúyes sir?‚Äù What are you guys wearing?! ‚ÄúObviously we are wearing tiger skins, for camouflage!‚Äù Now I don‚Äôt even have security to take all the psychopathic people in here, because my security are psychopathic themselves!!! Annnyyywwwaaayyy‚Ä¶ I figured it out! Bill, no bee and sick! No bee is actually no ‚ÄòB‚Äô, the letter! The only b we have is in bill! And if you take it off, what do you get. ‚Äúill‚Äù . And what is a synonym for ill. Sick. We have gotten pretty far on our journey of solving the question of the illuminati, although we have not quite accomplished the full desired outcome yet. What did all the most important people in egypt do when they were not prosecuting the poor? They were eating, of course! And what were the poor doing in their spare time? What any law-abiding heartwarming lovely citizens would be doing? Playing Sports, of course? And where are the rich buried? In coffins like boxes. When someone dies, hey eyes turn into 24pt roboto thin-line x‚Äôs in italics. Huh; box, x. An XBox of course! And what company makes sports for an Xbox? Electronic arts. We‚Äôve all heard of ‚ÄòE A Sports. It‚Äôs In The Game.‚Äô.if the rich are ‚Äòeat‚Äô and the poor are ‚Äòea‚Äô the only letter not used in both is the letter T! As in tea! A tea is going to come in handy. Even the word eat is just an anagram for tea! It‚Äôs all starting to make sense to me now! It‚Äôs all fitting together like the pieces of child‚Äôs jigsaw! Remember the plagues on Egypt? One of those must be a clue, but which one!? For this, we need to go back to original illuminati ideas, the eye and the triangle. What number do they have in common? 3, of course! A triangle has three sides! If you asked someone to draw a shape and the only hint you have them as to which shape it is was to tell them ‚Äò3‚Äô, then chances are they would draw a triangle! It even has three in its name ‚Äì tri-angle! And how many color cones does an eye have? You guessed it, three. And the third plague is: let‚Äôs see here‚Ä¶ Gnats. What has a gnat got to do with anything? That information is probably gnat even right (LOLZ)! Anyway, let‚Äôs keep going, there must be more to discover yet still. Who was the last pharaoh in Egypt? Cleopatra. She‚Äôs so famous, that there have been books and movies made about her! The movies would have been very old, if they were made when she was alive. So old in fact, that they probably used those old cameras with the crank thingy on the side and the reels. Remember the fishermen from before! They connect! The ‚Äòreels‚Äô! I think we now have all the information we need to prove that the illuminati is real. Lets see, what do we have: ill, oo, men, a tea, is gnat, reel. What happens if we squish them all together. Illoomenateaisgnatreel. Illoomenatea is gnat reel. Oh. Well, good thing we got that cleared up. Guess what peeps? I have made it to 35000 characters! Why is that so significant, you might ask? Because the world record is 35000 words! That means that all I have to do is replace every letter with a word. Like this: instead of writing ‚ÄòI‚Äôm back!‚Äô I could say ‚Äòinternet mascara beagle Australia catamaran kipper‚Äô and all you do is read the first letter! This would probably make for some nonsensical blubber, as one might say, but at least i‚Äôll beat the record! Also I have another Up-to-standard word idea to get more writing in! Instead of just writing a normal sentence I replace all the words with their respective dictionary definition! Yes, writer, that is a good awesome cool convenient and simple idea! So here goes: ‚Äòjumping cacti ate many jars containing marmalade‚Äô -> ‚Äòany of numerous succulent plants of the family Cactaceae, of warm, arid regions of the New World, having fleshy, leafless, usually spiny stems, and typically having solitary, showy flowers that are leaping or springing over an object the past tense of to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment constituting or formulating a large number of a broad-mouthed container, usually cylindrical and of glass or earthenware currently holding or including within its volume or area a jelly-like preserve in which small pieces of fruit and fruit rind, as of oranges or lemons, are suspended.‚Äô Wow, that took longer than I expected. Just so I don‚Äôt get sued, I am now informing you that those pieces of information were sourced from a well-designed, helpful and informative website currently named dictionary.com. And now, a word from our sponsor. *Kshhhhhhh* Have you ever been sick before? Then this pill is for you! We have a 100% guarantee that you will never get sick again!

Kshhhhhhh thank you for that lovely message from our sponsor, hooey kablooie. I need a topic.

This is a short skit entitled: ninjas: explorers of time and space! *intense music builds* yes sensei! I will punch that piece of wood so hard that it creates a wormhole in the 6th dimension! My apprentice, you have trained hard. There is now a one in one times ten to the million chance that using this wormhole will send us to a earth-like planet that will be habitable for all ninjas in the clan of the ninjapeeps. All hail the ninjapeeps! (You don‚Äôt actually have to) who said that?! Who would have the audacity to threaten the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps in such a way! I did. And you are? The Writer. Nice to meet you, my name is senseinohi, but that‚Äôs sensei to you. Howdy pawtna! No, we are actually japanese, not texan. Kong-nae-chae-waw, pawtna! Sensei, don‚Äôt respond! Don‚Äôt you remember what this man did? No. He was the one who disarmed the hailing of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninja peeps! Oh yes, that‚Äôs right. Sorry dude, but PREPARE TO BE THROWN INTO THE SIXTH DIMENSION, YOU DIRTY RASCAL! The sensei grabbed his handheld torpedo launcher and shot it at The Writer. It hit him and pushed him into the board! Do it! The Apprentice hit the board with all his might, and it broke apart. Not how you would think though, it actually compressed into a wormhole, shifting the spacetime fabric around it! (Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking, reader. Don‚Äôt ‚ÄòThey‚Äô always say to make a story believable!? And to that I say‚Ä¶ but it is. You see, if you are a small minded gherkin (hey! You! No insults or we‚Äôre going to have to stop this little ‚Äòplay‚Äô of yours!) ok‚Ä¶ whatever. You probably believe that when you push something, the far side of it moves instantly, right? WELL YOU‚ÄôD BE WRONG! Actually, the opposite side of the object moves in the same time it would take for sound to travel from you to it. Here‚Äôs an example: there is a lightning bolt with a hand far away from you. When it strikes the ground, it pushes a meal pole towards you, so one end is in its hand while the other is in yours. You will get pushed back at the exact time you hear to thunder! Isn‚Äôt that fabulous? That means that if the ninja punches faster than the speed of sound (a lot faster though) then he will be able to compress the board into a space time warping black hole) The Writer is plunged into the endless oblivion of the cascading incomprehension that is the sixth dimension. Little did the ninja peeps all hail the ninja peeps know, when you are in the sixth dimension, you can teleport right inside people and objects! (It actually depends on what kind of sixth dimension you are in. If you are in a four axes two time dimension, as in this skit, you can moves backwards and forwards in time and change the outcome of time, yet not travel directly to any possible outcome which you may have formed in the past. Also, with another axes under your belt, you can essentially disappear and reappear at will, yet with a time delay, which is nulled due to your cacophony of dimensions, specifically time.) so what The Writer did next was simple! He simply went back in time, and landed inside the sensei, causing him to not be thrown into the wormhole, causing him not to land in the sensei‚Ä¶ This is making less sense as we go. In the end, the universe gets confused, and tells us a message: universe.exe has stopped responding. Noooooooooooooooo ‚Äî Yep. And that is what I do with my life essentially. Gotta go now sea ya! I‚Äôm back! With a conspiracy that will blow your minds/mind if you are human! Zooreka is the easiest game to play if you have the slightest bit of mathematical knowledge! When choosing what to roll for, it is sooooo obvious which on the choose using basic knowledge. I‚Äôm not going to tell you, because next time you play it you will figure it out (if you even HAVE zooreka). Now that I think About it, that wasn‚Äôt really a conspiracy, was it :(. I have a reward for you reader. If you have truly made it this far than‚Ä¶ Give me your email and I will send you the answer to the zooreka challenge, free of charge! Send an email to rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, inquiring. Also, you can ask me any other important questions you might have! In section 18w08b of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it CLEARLY STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (that‚Äôs me!) will reply to ANY email set to the inbox of rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com to the best of his ability (not including spam tho). Hey! I just realised that when I wrote the word color, it get a red squiggle underneath! What a sham! ShamWOW! In section 18o25g02i22 it states that anyone, not only the king of the oddly colored farm animals, is allowed to spell color without a u! Hurrah! Hurrah! Three cheers for the rainbow fluffysheep handbook! (But that was only two, Harold. Whatever.) and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the way Color was born. THE END. I‚Äôm back! And do I have an exciting subject for you! No! I don‚Äôt! Ha, gotcha there, didn‚Äôt I! Wow, it just started raining. Oh wait, it‚Äôs snow! Not just any snow, mind you, but it‚Äôs topicsnow! Yay! All these great topics falling softly from the sky. What could be better. I‚Äôm now walking down the street. Hey you! Ye? Is that a topicman? Yes sir, tis! Well ain‚Äôt that great. If want to get the best topics, I must climb mt.Big. Hey look, there‚Äôs some kids having a topicball fight! How fun. Noooooo! A topicalanche! (That doesn‚Äôt even make sense!!! The word avalanche doesn‚Äôt even have the world snow in it! ) Since I died, i didn‚Äôt get any topics. Sooooooo yea. *cue awkward elevator music* ding do do ding dong ding do do ding dong. *taps his foot* *hums 90‚Äôs pop song* grabs chainsaw from behind his ear and cuts the elevator cord, plunging the box of awkwardness in to the darkness of forgetfulness and loss of meaning. Forget‚Ä¶ Forget‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. You drift into a deep dreamless sleep, waking up to an elevator of twisted metal wreckage resembling a dead animal carcasses. Beside is the corpse of‚Ä¶ of‚Ä¶ an onion?!?! Wow, who knew onions could be so awkward :o. I just read what I wrote and it makes less sense than I thought. Little did you guys know, that today you would get a great piece of text to read. I didn‚Äôt even know that. You know that guy from shamWOW! He always said all these great things about that weird sponge? Yea, that was a short topic. Im gone. Im back! Wait, how did i type if i was gone? With my mmmiiiinnnnddddd‚Ä¶ woooooooo creeeeeeeepy! Anyway, this is what i was thinking. I feel really sorry for water molecules! All they do all their lives is slowly get raised up slowly until they land in a cloud with their friends! Wahoo! Or, so you think. In reality, at any moment they could fall to their impending doom! They drop thousands of meters to the ground, only now realizing that they are miles from home!! They take the nearest river trying to get home, before repeating the cycle! They teach us this horror story in kindergarten, masking the brutal morbidity of it by articulating the conundrum using macroscopic convoluted words! Like ‚Äòevaporation‚Äô, more like flying up to the sky knowing that it‚Äôs your final moment ‚Äì ation! Condensation!?!? More like con ‚Äì ned by your kindergarten teacher inti thinking that this means water gently floating to the surface of the earth, when it really means death by lack of parachute! How could you be so ‚Äì dense ‚Äì ation! (Public service announcement: this is an anonymous relative spakin‚Äô: *where is he? Dunno.* this was test, and only a test. Had this been a real public service announcement then i would have ‚Äì not been here! Harharhar ! Stop making fun of harold! He was only late for that one clock commercial and now you guy just have to ‚Äì its OK bob, i don‚Äôt care about the Larry squad. They don‚Äôt bother me no longer. KK harold‚Ä¶.. umm‚Ä¶ this was a te ‚Äì wait, did we already do that part? Uh, ya i think so‚Ä¶. so this is awkward. Ya, sooooooo ‚Äì *in the echoey distance* cut to the commercial break! What the heck do i pay you for? To‚Ä¶ get‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ coffee, sir. Oh, you the coffee boy? Why the hack did my coffee not have any cream in it yesterday!? I almost burnt my mouth into non-existence! I was told not to put in in, sir. By who? Lets just say i got a‚Ä¶ Higher Calling. You‚Ä¶ you m-m-mean that The Boss called? Yes, budget cuts he said. No more cream he said. No more name-brand cereal! Nooooo if my cereal is packed in a bag i swear on my neighbors cousins dogs bone that i will take every cereal bag, pour out all the cereal, and put them into the boxes that i saved from the name brand cereal!!! Is this‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt. Oh, try me. Yea, now that i think about it you probably would do that. Why was i here again? Oh ya‚Ä¶ CUT TO A COMMERCIAL ALREADY! We don‚Äôt have any commercials sir, we got voted unanimously by popular vote not to have any commercials. Well obviously the public didn‚Äôt want‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ di- it all makes sense now! The budget cut is BECAUSE of us not playing enough commercials! But sir, our quota ends tomorrow! We need to have played 50837 commercials! There is. Only. One. Way. Play all the commercials at 100x speed! Is that even LeGaL?! Of course it is! We might have to have an epilepsy warning at the start though. Don‚Äôt people get epilepsy from watching fast images? This is a radio station, so people can just hear it! Ummm‚Ä¶ this is an earlepsy warning! HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHhahahahhahha hehe he‚Ä¶ heh. That wasn‚Äôt funny, steven.) And back to our regular program. I just started a sentence with a preposition! Isn‚Äôt that, like, seven years bad luck or something? Well I can solve that. Section 1 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook says that the king of oddly colored (not coloured like some LOSERS would write) farm animals has full veto to start any sentence with a preponderance. (What the hooey is a preponderance? It says here that it means to be greater than something. Well, the king of oddly colored is full of preponderance towards everyone else! Mwahahaahaha!) Now i can start with a preposition too. Well that worked. (The reason that I used the number 1 is because it has become forgotten among numbers. You see, 1 isn‚Äôt considered a prime number! Like what the hey! Its only factors are one and itself!) Do you think that when a particle is beckoned into existence, it uses one of those slot machines with the big arm? And the 777 of the particle world is getting‚Ä¶ Hmmmm. I actually have now idea. Maybe just hydrogen! Hydrogen is pretty sweet for blowing people up. But then when your becoming a particle, you have to use it and see what you get. A typical particle would be at one. Here is an example: *cue southern accent* sweat was rolling down my face like the Rolling Stones. I can‚Äôt believe it has come to this. I force my hand over to the lever on the side of the machine, which appeared to be taunting me. It‚Äôs lights and horror movie little-kid-singing-or-jack‚Äìin‚Äìthe‚Äìbox (the reason i did that is because I was putting a space between every word, AND jack-in-the-box already has them too) seemed to violently clash against the darkness and dread of the outside world. I clenched the red metal ball with all my might. It was cold as Alaskan ice on a early winter morning, and its color was the blood of the many particles who had to go through with this also. I jerked my limb backwards, causing the huge metal pole to turn on a skewed axis. It came to a stop after turning a quarter of the way with a hard crack, like the crack of a whip. I refocused my attention to the screen. The cylinders were rolling faster than A grands prix racers tyre. Suddenly, the first one came to an abrupt halt. I stared at it, but struggled to read the letter because of my complete shock. H. It said H. I should have been happy, I know, but I wasn‚Äôt completely out of the woods yet. There was a tiny times two symbol beside it. I didn‚Äôt care. I pulled the arm again, not knowing what life-changing, devastating thing was to come. It spinning thing that doesn‚Äôt have a name stopped. O. No. It was the letter O! Now I too will have to live this tortuous fate! Do you think that water parties breathe? Because then, when they did, they would just be hydrogen for a very short amount of time. ENOUGH WITH THE WATER PARTICLES!! I have a conspiracy theory! You know those spinny poles that barbers have? Of course you do! They are probably used to hypnotise people into getting their hair cut there! #subSPINinalmessagesfromcruelbarbers. There is a haircut called ‚Äúmeet me at McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù that is BANNED where I live. goodbye. and remember‚Ä¶ barbers are eevviill! I‚Äôm back! Did you know that palm trees aren‚Äôt actually trees? Yea, that‚Äôs right, palm TREES!!! I think that they‚Äôre bushes or something. That makes me angry! in section 6.02214129√ó10^23 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that trees are trees.. no matter how small (Horton hears a who). On a completely unrelated note, there was this old man who painted a baseball like infinite times so now it‚Äôs like the size of a truck. I was listening to this amazing radio station and this is ACTUALLY what it was about. I will try to rein-act it as accurately as possible. ‚ÄúRecently, a Russian double-agent was poisoned in England. Also, there was a man who had ten million euros, which he gambled until he got nine million of it back. he was so mad that he didn‚Äôt get it all, that he robbed his employers to get the money back. now he is a counsellor for people struggling with a gambling addiction. he‚Äôs a great lad, he is, he‚Äôs had a great life. By the way, its my mother in laws 100th birthday today! Go over to her house and say hello! I have her post code written on the back of my phone. Also, there was a man who invented the windup radio and the shoe phone charger who died this week.‚Äù I know what you‚Äôre thinking: there‚Äôs no way this actually happened, right? YES THIS WAS REAL! And I thought it was pretty funny hehehe. I need write all o the funny things that happen in my life in here. So today I was in the library, minding my own business, when I noticed someone was drawing cartoons and there were a whole bunch of little kids surrounding him (I‚Äôm guessing from ages 2-5). Classic movie plot device that never happens in real life, so I was already skeptical. He was drawing a zombie. ‚ÄúAnd now you see, the zombies chin is like a chimpanzees bubblecopter asparagus. (Wait what? Lets try this again) And now you see, the zombies chinos like a‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ A line.‚Äù‚Äùwhy does the zombie look like its from the Simpsons?‚Äù‚Äùbecause real zombies are too scary for you kids. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not drawing the ones from the walking dead, for example.‚Äù‚ÄùI‚Äôve seen that movie!‚Äù‚Äùyeah me too!!‚Äù‚Äùumm.. Ok, how many of you guys have seen the walking dead?‚Äù*everyone puts their hand up* the only reason I thought that story was funny is because that kind of thing only happens in movies. What‚Äôs up with the saying, ‚Äòeasy as pie‚Äô? Like what the hooey! Pie is really hard to make. The pie crust always ends up being soggy.‚Äôpiece of cake‚Äô is a saying too! What‚Äôs with all these people that think baking is easy! (Now that I think about it, this is a weird thing to be mad about). Maybe I just need to calm down. NOOOO!!! In section 888 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that the king of oddly colored farm animal (that‚Äôs me!) hereby declares that the sayings ‚Äòeasy as pie‚Äô and ‚Äòpiece of cake‚Äô are now changed to ‚Äòeasy as bread‚Äô and ‚Äòpiece of bread‚Äô. I just realised that I was typing with my phone in portrait mode! Now I turned it into landscape and I feel so freeeeeee!!! I need to come up with other things that I do randomly‚Ä¶ Like the rainbow fluffysheep hanbooks challenge booklet subset! If I am talking about some random subject, I will now randomly put a challenge for you, the reader (which probably doesn‚Äôt exist) to do! Piece of bread! In section 7 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset it STATES that your challenge is: get anyone you know to say piece of bread instead of piece of cake! (They probably won‚Äôt do it unless you tell them the reason (or you have really good friends)) i have to shorten the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset so that I don‚Äôt have to write the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset all of the time. From now on, it is considered TRFSHCBS. I probably news to add vowels to pronounce it. And take out ‚Äòthe‚Äô. RAFLUSHEHACHABOOS. Pronounced ra-fluh-shee-ha-cha-boo-s. that‚Äôll work. I need to write more to fill my writer quota. That just sounded cool to say. I probably write about‚Ä¶ 100 words a day. Well I started today at the zombie thing, so yea. What‚Äôs going to be the next big thing in the future? Technically, I‚Äôm writing this in the past, so you guys can email me at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com and tell me what the future‚Äôs like! The only problem is that I will only receive it in the future. Another one of my BRILLIANT ideas gone down the tubes. Goodbye. The world is unjust! I worked for hours on end, making an app for a coding competition. And then they announced‚Ä¶ We made it to the country finals! The COUNTRY! By that time, my app had over 5,000 downloads! It was amazing. But we came in second. Guess what the prize was for second?!?! TAKE A WILD GUESS!!!! NOTHING! This wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad, but at the competition they were giving away free stuff. And GUESS WHO GOT SAID FREE STUFF?!?! MY BROTHER, THAT‚ÄôS WHO!!! So in the end, after spending half the year doing a competition, my brother, who did absolutely nothing, got more out of it then me. The world is unjust! Unfair! Prejudiced! Biased! Fascist! (Wait, that was autocorrected). I just needed to get my anger out. When I wrote autocorrected, it autocorrected it to autocorrect ex! That‚Äôs the last time i buy an apple product. How many devices companies are fruit? There‚Äôs apple obviously, and blackberry, and pear (I‚Äôve seen pear shops in cities) and raspberries (as in the greatest computer of all time, raspberry pi). That could be the most expensive fruit salad ever! What would you like to order, moisuer? I‚Äôll have the fruit salad. Oui, oui. Harold! That costs $5k! So? I bet it‚Äôs good! KSHHH and here‚Äôs how the skit would have went if I had autocorrect on. Why would you like to order, moisture? You guys have moisture in this restaurant? that‚Äôs not up to the code for restaurants. i‚Äôll have to tell the building inspector! Oh yes, anyway, I‚Äôll have the fruit salad. Out, out! Runnnn! I‚Äôm coming Harold! That waiter must have something about fruit salad! Maybe he had a bad experience as a child. Wow, I sure went off on a tangent. Do you think that it would be cool if apple made all their devices different fruit names! The iPad pro could be the watermelon, cause its so big. And the iPhone nano could be the strawberry (other berry names are trademarked) what else? A phone with a lot of space could be the peach, because the pit is like the hard-drive! (That was a bit far fetched) and the MacBook could be an orange because when you open it it it cut in the inside‚Ä¶ Cuz laptops are like two parts‚Ä¶ You know? (and if you cut a grape in half and put it in the microwave it will make plasma (just thought you‚Äôd like to know that)) Earbuds could be cherries because they always have the two cherries which are like the ear things! And they‚Äôd call the charger ‚ÄòThe Root‚Äô. Why a great idea! I will let apple use these names and I only need a 0.00000000000001% share In the company. Even though I did work hard at this. I just thought of something amazing! If you are in a shop and you see a jar of nondescript sauces (mayacamole) and it costs two bucks. TWO BUCKS!!! You know for a FACT that the shop just across town sells them for one-fifty. The shop is five minutes away. If you choose to go to the shop, then you my friend are working for minimum wage! (Except in the case that you have to walk back. If so, just buy the mayacamole at the former option( or just get salsa. It‚Äôs on sale! (Which probably means that its old))) wasn‚Äôt that interesting? Here‚Äôs another situation. You are buying a $400,000 home (average price right now I‚Äôd say) and you think ‚Äúwhat a steal!‚Äù And your neighbour thinks ‚Äúwhere did i put that shotgun cartridge again? But is you think about it you are working for 1,667 weeks to pay for that! (Assuming 8 hours a day, five days a week at minimum wage) That‚Äôs 32 YEARS! Let‚Äôs say you work for 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $20 an hour, that‚Äôs still 238 weeks! That‚Äôs still five years! Just buy a camper van for goodness sake! I just got to thinking; how many tiny changes would a cereal company have to make to earn twice as much from a box of cereal? (Assuming people still bought the same amount ( I think I can trust the general population)) it turns out that if we want to double the profits by decreasing things by ten percent, we would have to do it seven times. Which means instead of selling these cornflakes: Box height: 1 meter; Box length: 1 meter; Box width: 1 meter; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 100%; Percent of box filled with bag: 100%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 100%; Production cost: 10 cents; they could sell these: Box height, width & length: 0.9 meters; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 90%; Percent of box filled with bag: 90%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 90%; Production cost: 9 cents; they would make double the profits! Hooray! Well that‚Äôs that. You know how people always have weird names on the interweb? Well I came up with Internet name generator! (Random adjective)(Random noun)(Use a deck of cards for this part. Take out the jokers and face cards, and tens are now zeros. Pick out numbers until you get a club) additional things include: (pick a card. If it is three or lower, put X at the start and end)(pick a card. If it is an ace, replace noun with random country. If it is a two, replace noun with Internet related company + fan.) let me try this. Here is what I got: FoulSoup31, XxInternalAle10xX, StrengthenedFillet49458, MediocreElectrode20, and EpicRedditFan7515. That was a lot more accurate than I thought it would be. Bye. Hello! I need to rant more! I am going to start a sentence without knowing where it is leading. I wish I could buy a mocha for my clown pants while aliens eat your toes which glisten in the sliver of wind. That was fun. Why is orange so popular? There are SO MANY WORDS that don‚Äôt rhyme with other words too, like engine, silver and angry (hangry isn‚Äôt a real word as far as I know). And people know that orange rhymes with ‚Äúdoor hinge‚Äù! Some people say that doesn‚Äôt count. But there is another! Sporangia! Well, it‚Äôs pretty close. I think it‚Äôs like fern spores. Well remember, whenever you see the color orange, type #boycottorange, so people stop taking pictures of orange things. For Halloween, people will carve watermelons instead of pumpkins. Trump will no longer be president because of his orange skin. Oranges (the fruit) will be replaced by reds! (The soon to be fruit). The sun will disappear, or if we want to not go extinct, just change its color to blue. I have a map of Europe on my wall, which has the countries in different colors. BEWARE IF YOU LIVE IN: The UK, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Denmark and Armenia. You guys will soon disappear off the face of the earth. And my favourite pop is club orange! Nooooo! And Jupiter will disappear too! Now that I think about it, losing orange things wouldn‚Äôt be that bad compared to other colors. Like blue. We would lose water, blue paint, the second book in the Rust comic book series, the sky, Pluto and that one triple angry bird. That would be awful. In section 255 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it STATES that the king of oddly colors farm animals (me again) will never make all blue things disappear, but he may make all orange things disappear. Now you guys don‚Äôt have to worry! :)! Why are kings higher than queens in a deck of cards? That‚Äôs really sexist! People think that king is worth thirteen and queens are worth twelve! (If you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm mocking that people that get offended by everything). Why do vegetarians worry about hurting animals, but not plants!?!? Plants have feelings too (I think)! In fact, vegetarians kill MORE than carnivores. Instead of a whole family eating a chicken, if they are all vegetarians, then they will probably kill hundreds of plants! Think about THAT, people! In this whole LoTeEv, I have probably offended a lot of you guys. Sorry bout that. In section 1029384756 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that if the mug of oddly colored farm animals (me again) offends any reader, he is sincerely sorry *citation not needed because of section 12345679 of the RFSH*. Why are the money symbols not consistent? Like there‚Äôs ‚Ç¨uros, ¬•en and ¬£ounds. But why $ollars? Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to be dollar$. That makes more sense. Now I won‚Äôt get that nervous eye twitch every time I see that symbol. ‚ÄúHey look, I just found this ten dollar bill on the ground! Hey why the flop is he doing that?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a Thing that he does‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have a great idea for this! Whenever he gets near money his eye twitches! That means we can find money on the ground just by watching him!‚Äù And that‚Äôs how I lost all my friends. It turns out that was the only reason they liked me. Wait what is this ?? That is so ?eird. Goodbye. I‚Äôm back! Hahahaha gotcha! I was just kidding about that. But you would have never known that! I‚Äôm going to try to make words using only the top row of letters. Hmmmm‚Ä¶ Lets see. Tip, rip, port, type, write, writer, typewriter. Fascinating. I‚Äôm going to make a fake movie trailer. Using only words. Here we go: [Have you ever‚Ä¶]{scene of old woman churning milk}[wanted to‚Ä¶]{scene of older woman churning what is now cream(the reason she is older is not because it is a different person, but because we filmed it after}[churn your own butter?!?!]{scene of even older woman churning what is now butter (the reason she is even older is because we got a new actor because the other one retired (she used to put tires on her vehicle, and now she does it again))}[This is a great movie, if you are an IDIOT][‚Äúthis is a great movie‚Äù][i had popcorn while I watched this movie, and I really enjoyed it, it soothed the pain of having to watch that movie][‚ÄúI really enjoyed it, it really soothed‚Äù][i actually really enjoyed the movie!][wait‚Ä¶ What? You know we‚Äôre not paying you guys right? Oh. Anyway, ‚ÄúI actually really enjoyed the movie!‚Äù][while being on an oil rig?!?!]{well‚Ä¶ No, but anyway (shows a picture of an old woman churning butter which is thick and black and worth a lot more than butter)}[Coming soon to you][this summer][and fall][and winter as well][lets just add spring too][The Lard of the Rigs] That was actually fun! {Warning: if you use this movie name you will BE SUED actually now that I think about it you probably won‚Äôt. In fact, if you DO actually make this into a movie, send it to me} Do you guys think I‚Äôm random enough? I really hope so! In section 5647382910 of the RAFLUSHE ‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember. That challengey things name. But anyway, make that movie. Plz. I‚Äôm board. And not just any old barn-wood planks, mind you, but a board of fine stained oak as the flooring in the White House. By!!! I‚Äôm back! No, just kidding, I‚Äôm front! I have a topic that I‚Äôm actually very serious about. Puzzles. Am I the only one that thinks that puzzles are the most useless thing in the world?!?! That‚Äôs like the PROOF that the human race have made it too far. When we actually make challenges that we have to face OURSELVES, AND WE PAY FOR THEM! We are literally paying to give ourselves problems! We have enough problems! Well at least I do ;). Probprobprobprobleeeeeemsomomo! I‚Äôm going to type something about politics to sound super cool. As you know, recently president Obama (That was like years ago) oh‚Ä¶ Sozsozsoz. As you know, recently president Nixon (no, that‚Äôs not exactly right) Oh yea, I forgot. As you know, recently president Lincoln (ARGH! We are not doing this anymore) was a president before Donald (finally) Duck! (Nooooo! It‚Äôs TRUMP) What? No! You think you‚Äôre SOOO smart person who talks in the brackets. Actually, trump is a businessman in that show where he says YOU‚ÄôRE FIRED!!! What, you probably also think that a bodybuilder actor that says ‚ÄúGEAT TOUW THAE CHAEOPPAER‚Äù is a governor too!?! Hahahaha‚Ä¶ Donald Duck was a great president. His slogan was ‚ÄúI will fight for american democrats‚Äù and he bathes in gold. What a great job. Money is so dirty though! Now that I think about it, he probably gets the money wholesale from the mint. Or else, how could he afford it?! I have a new segment in my text now! It‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúRandom Fun Fact‚Äù segment! (Now that I think about it, I never know when to use those ‚Äú. I think it‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äù when someone is talking and ‚Äù for saying something sarcastically or shortening a word. For example: ‚ÄúHello there Chuckie! How‚Äôya doing ‚Äònice guy‚Äô. Were you being sarcastic? Yes, but how could you see the little apostrophes when I‚Äôm talking to you?‚Ä¶ Science.‚Äù And that‚Äôs how they work) where was I? Random fax! I will send all of my readers a fax with has facts on in! How brilliant! The facts of the paragraph are‚Ä¶ Ice cream was invented in china, something that is ‚Äòblue‚Äô (got it right there!) Is actually every color BUT blue, and I like cheese. And the country of the paragraph is‚Ä¶ Mexico! Why not, right? Did you ever wonder how records work? (Just in case you don‚Äôt know, a record is a thingy where you put a round black thing on a majig and it puts a sharp whatchamacallit on that and funny rhythmic sound emerge and tickle your ear holes) I know how they WORK, with ridges and diaphragms and blah Blah BLah BLAh BLAH‚Ä¶ But how do they WORK?!?! Like who was sitting there in their layzboy having diet Pepsi (or popsee to avoid copyright infringement (and that‚Äôs when I checked my forehead, and sure enough, there was a mint there)) And then they realise‚Ä¶ Hey! Bumpy things can make sounds! I just can‚Äôt get my head around it (clockwise is my preference). Do you ever wonder what the worst collections are in the world? I currently collect words, pins and the ‚Äúto kill a mockingbird‚Äù series (not much work ( besides the fact that I have to give them (it) back to the library by tomorrow morning ( the last time I will ever bring a library book late again is when I borrowed the book entitled ‚ÄòHow to sharpen a pencil for dummies‚Äô (Don‚Äôt blame me! It was the ‚ÄòExtended and revised‚Äô edition! They had all the technical ‚Äòlead vs. graphite‚Äô stuff added.) an they called out my name over the loudspeaker telling me to return the book immediately or I would be fired (yes, I worked at the library (I never could figure out the Dewey decimal system)). Now that I think about it, they never said what book to bring, they just said my name. Oh no, I never handed in the ‚Äòhow to sharpen a pen for dummies‚Äô book! (Which I rate a 3/5, ‚Äúwould not borrow again‚Äù because of its poor layout and overall structure (although the information was altogether helpful)) what collections do YOU have reader? Find out next time on ‚Äúdeer or no deer!‚Äù (Remember forehead sweets) oh no! I wrote how to kill a mocking bird! I meant ‚Äòpow do gill hamma (hammer) king turd‚Äô. Phew. Got outta that one. I have a new topic! A high-quality, name-brand, box-not-bag topic! I figured out a great business plan! Make onsies! Not just out of clothes, but out of everything! Like: Did you eat two bowls of granola this morning? Well ONSIE! [poured granola into one bowl, causing it to be crushed under its own weight] do you have two hands? Well ONSIE! [handshakes himself] Do you have twins? Well ONSIE! [wait‚Ä¶ How is this supposed to work?] Get yours now at your local Amazon (which might not be very accessible if you don‚Äôt live in South America) for a free trial! *happy tune* Onsie, Onesie! Life is better with a onsie. Spin a web, less than two. ONSIE! (I think that was to the tune of Spider-Man (I mean Smiter-Can) Onsies only cost‚Ä¶ Whatever you want them to cost! Yeah, I think i‚Äôm going to go now. Baiii! Wait.. What? When did i wrote that ONSIE thing?? I just came back and I do not remember doing that. What the hat does ‚ÄòSpin a web, less than two‚Äù even mean? That is some weird stuff. So today I listened to that radio station again, and it was totally worth it. He was talking about these married people in Germany that are going to a Walking Dead convention for their 17th anniversary. Weird. Weird, weird, WEIRD!!! You know guitar tuna? Probably not. It is an app where you tune your guitar (obviously). I thought of how they could make so much more money! If they had bass tuna, electric guitar tuna, acoustic guitar tuna. BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE THE SAME THING!!! They would make so much money! Wait. What about canned tuna! (Also, if they thought in that way, then bass tuna would be extremely perplexing because they are both fish). Well, that‚Äôs my stuff for today! Hallo! I‚Äôm back! And I don‚Äôt get house decorations nowadays. People put old stuff in their house, and they think it makes it look amazing! People always talk about that ‚ÄòVintage Look‚Äô which is just putting old stuff that people fifty years ago would have said ‚Äúwhy do you have a *fill in the blank with an old thing* in your HOUSE?!?!‚Äù In their house. I should rant. Like what I‚Äôm doing now. I‚Äôm just talking about random things just like the flaming chicken person does just to fill up space on the page. I should also write long words like pnumonoultramicrkscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and disestablishmentarianism . Actually, since it only matters for words count, I should just type really small words. Hi, my name is jo. (Its not actually, but I need to type small words). I eat a lot of pie and I love it too. It is yum in my tum. Wow that was probably really boring to read (and to write). Hello there, reader! I‚Äôve just decided that I want to talk to you. I always seem to do all of the talking, but maybe I should give you a chance! *really really long drawn out super weird and uneventful awkward silence*. Oh I see what‚Äôs happening. Either you can‚Äôt talk to me because you are in the future and I‚Äôm in the past, causing us to not be able to communicate due to the sad reality that is the third dimension, or‚Ä¶ Your trying to talk to me on a walkie-talkie! I could never figure out those things either. They‚Äôre so confusing. Lets see‚Ä¶ Oh, there it is! The ‚Äòwalkie-talkie almanac: a complete collection of all the knowledge YOU will need to acquire (did you know acquire is also a board game? If you are ever playing, always buy America, and then buy quantum stocks (well it worked that one time I played (are you saying that games are DIFFERENT every time you play them!?!? (That‚Äôs the last time I mesmerise fifty-three rounds of go fish))) to use your very own‚Ä¶ WALKIE-TALKIE! (well what else would the walkie-talkie almanac be about!?!?) lets see‚Ä¶ Contents‚Ä¶ It says the contents page is on page 1‚Ä¶ Wait ‚Äì WHAT?!?! The contents page has a line for the contents page! That‚Äôs like a website having a link to itself! (Which is not a bad idea for my own website to get a lot of views (like I could a a tab on my website called ‚Äúthe best sites on the web! And I would have links to places like YouTube and twitter (or whatever you young‚Äôuns go to these days! When I was a lad I used to play ‚ÄòPok√©mon Pearl‚Äô and ‚ÄòFacebook‚Äô now you kids are all on her newfangled ‚ÄòPok√©mon Go get outta here‚Äô and yer ‚ÄòSnapperChatters‚Äô (i bet if you are reading this in ten years you won‚Äôt know that I was talking about Pokemon go and snapchat (or how I got from talking to you to young ones (btw: if you are reading this in 2028 or beyond: welcome to the distant past! (Now that in think about it, I started reading the longest text ever by ‚ÄòSam‚Äô (real readers will know who that is) when it was about ten years too! And I don get the references to stuff like ‚Äòneopets‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Matrix‚Äô))))))) Okay where is it‚Ä¶ Oh there; it says that the ‚Äòpretty much how to use it‚Äô section is on page -3! Well thats eas- how do I go to page -3! Lets see‚Ä¶ Oh look! They have a ‚Äòhow to go to negative pages section too! It‚Äôs on page -7. Noooo!! I guess I‚Äôll just look it up on the Internet. Ok first you have to turn the book into antimatter‚Ä¶ Ok got that done‚Ä¶ Now just turn to the page without the negative! Well that was easy. I‚Äôm on page 7 now. It says all you have to do is convert the book into an antimatter form and- hey this sounds familiar! I‚Äôll go to page three now. It says here, and I quote: ‚Äúto use the walkie talkie, hold in that little button on the side o the walkie talkie‚Äù. Did you that reader! Can you try talking to me now? Oh yes! I can hear you! Oh wait, I‚Äôm on the wrong station. I‚Äôm on number five, but your on number six. I have to click a button to change my station number! Too much work. Do you think I‚Äôm crazy because I talk to myself? I‚Äôm not! Yes you are. I am not! Isn‚Äôt talking to yourself the DEFINITION of crazy? I‚Äôm not talking to myself. The who do you think I am? Oh yea. I‚Äôm your imaginary friend, RatGuy! Don‚Äôt you remember me! No. Oh *sniffle* well *odd breathing patterns* we *tear emerging from eyeball* used *pure weeping* to- I CAN‚ÄôT TALK TO YOU WHEN YOUR CRYING BECAUSE YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING YOURSELF! Technically, since you‚Äôre talking to yourself your also interrupting your self. I guess I am. Continue, RatGuy. As I was saying: we used to skate around on a skateboard together. We would have so much fun doing tricks that other kids could have only DREAMED of, like the ‚Äòground ollie‚Äô and the ‚Äòdown-the-curb‚Äô. We moved at speeds that the other kids couldn‚Äôt even begin to imagine. 90% the speed of light. But RatGuy?

Yes? If sewers moving at 90%!‚Ä¢ the speed of light, would the air compression deflecting us not cause us do develop into an expanding plasma fireball. This is a story, Writer. Stories don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòwork‚Äô. I NEED TO STOP!!! I keep writing all this nonsensical blubber and I can‚Äôt stop. Are you, the reader not so confused and uncomprehensive of what I‚Äôve just been typing to the last hour!?!? Oh wait, you can‚Äôt tell me if you were or not, your walkie-talkie isn‚Äôt on the same channel as mine. I just realised something. I work hard to you guys trying to give you quality topics and extra-special rants. And how do people repay me? By writing more than me!!! I spend all day thinking about things that i want to put into this, and then I type it all up! And then I see that people want quantity, not quality! But no! You loyal readers will have to deal with me not writing 500 words a day, because I‚Äôm thinking of things and stuff. I was just thinking, I need complain about my life more. That‚Äôs what all the people are doing nowadays. ‚ÄúOh, my life is so hard, I just broke a fingernail!‚Äù BIG DEAL! ‚ÄúOh, my life is hard too, i just broke a finger‚Äù BUG REAL! ‚Äù oh my life is mildy uncomfortable and difficult, I broke all of my fingers, toes, limbs, necks, mothers vases, favourite Guinness book of world records records, my most-used language rules, that kinda stuff. Just in case you didn‚Äôt realise, I‚Äôm an introvert. So I have lots of problems with‚Ä¶ People. And my guess is that you do too! So here are some crucial situations for you to read and laugh at me because you know I can‚Äôt hear you! 1: You know when your talking to someone and you can‚Äôt figure out what part of their face to look at? Is it their eyes, or their nose, or their mouth? So then you kinda unfocus your eyes and stare in the middle of their face, like your looking right through them? And then they finished talking and you have no idea what they just said? CUZ THAT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME! 2: when your talking to someone and they are saying important stuff, but instead of listening to what they‚Äôre saying your just saying yes whenever they stop talking for a little bit? 3: when you are going into a building and there are people behind you, and you can‚Äôt figure out if you should hold the door open for them or not? If you don‚Äôt and they‚Äôre too close, It will probably hit him/her in the face but if you do and they‚Äôre to far, its really awkward because you are just standing there for a really long time. Have any of these things happened to you? Leave your answer in the comment section below! (There actually isn‚Äôt one, I can‚Äôt figure that much out). Hedgehogs must find it really hard to have birthdays! If they have lots of balloons everywhere, they probably pop them; the police come because they think that its gunshots, and there goes all the hedgehogs friends. I‚Äôm sure glad I‚Äôm now a hedgehog! In section 333 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that free pop-proof balloons will be sent to any hedgehogs in need. Well goodbye, I‚Äôm off to slay a fantastic fedora fanatic! But before I go, I have to ask one thing. Did you really make it this far? Because if you have, the you have been promoted from herder of the rainbow fluffysheep to shearer of the rainbow fluffysheep. It‚Äôs a title only few in the world have. Did you know I also make comics? Probably not, because I haven‚Äôt posted any yet! Well stay tuned for them someday. What‚Äôs up with everyone wanting to deep fry things? Deep fried mars bars, deep fries cool aid! Well I‚Äôve come up with a new food type! ‚ÄòShallow fried‚Äô available at all good pharmancy checkout lines beside the mayacamole and the taco sauce. (That sounds really good!(jut i case you didn‚Äôt know, mayacamole is mayo and guacamole combined. Doesn‚Äôt that sound MAGICALLY DELICIOUS!!!( I think it does))) shallow fried stuff has half the fat, uses half the ‚Äòdeep fry juice‚Äô (whatever they put in there) and has have the flavour! For twice the price! Even though we never had an original price. Whatever. Do you know what‚Äôs the worst? Trying to buy computer ‚Äì related things in charity shops. I was at value village, and I saw a USB. It was 64 gigabytes! That‚Äôs pretty good (I bet if your are reading this in the distant future than you think that a 64 gigabyte USB is awful. Well it isn‚Äôt in this day and age) I thought, so I went to buy it. It‚Äôs only two bucks! Wow, what a steal. I looked closer at it and that‚Äôs when I realised. It said 64 MEGABYTES!!! DO YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE THAT IS! if you are from the distant future than you are probably thing ‚Äòthat‚Äôs like nothing‚Äô and you‚Äôd be right. It can only store like 60 million letters! That‚Äôs only 15 million words! That‚Äôs only a million sentences! That‚Äôs only 200,000 paragraphs! That‚Äôs only 20,000 chapters! That‚Äôs only 1,000 Books! That‚Äôs only 250 quadrilogies! Now that I think about it, 250 quadrilogies isn‚Äôt that bad. If you couldn‚Äôt tell, I used a method called Fermi Estimation, though a little more precise. In Fermi Estimation, you can be off by 100x in either direction and it doesn‚Äôt really matter. According to Fermi Estimation, this is me. Age: 10 Number of eyes: 1 Social Security Number: 1000000 PIN code: 1000 number of limbs: 1 people in my family: 1 (forever alone). That‚Äôs why I like Fermi Estimation. I actually didn‚Äôt tell you why I like it. Oh well. Where I live, they use blackcurrant in everything. It‚Äôs pretty much a replacement for grape. But am I the only one who thinks that grape flavoured things taste way better? Whenever I get something blackcurrant flavoured I offer it someone, because they usually like it (and I hate it). Works well for me!! I was just thinking about tides. Way back in the day, wouldn‚Äôt tides make no sense? The sea would just get higher and lower and there was no reasoning behind it. Maybe that‚Äôs why they thought sea monsters existed. No what I think about it though, the moon pulling on the water is kinda even crazier than that. And now for a commercial break. Kshhhhhh ‚Äì Tacos‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I LOVE EM! And you can to for only ten easy payments of ten bucks! (That‚Äôs deer by the way) tacos can make you feel fuzzy in the inside. That‚Äôs because of the mould that comes FREE with every purchase! And there‚Äôs no artificial additives either! (We did that by adding so many additives that instead of adding it to the taco, we were technically adding the taco to the additives). What are you waiting for! I‚Äôm waiting for this commercial to end so I can get paid! Call now at 1800-GOT-PUNK to order a taco from Teddys Tacos (or would it be Teddies) and you will get a free rent-a-friend with your purchase! But there‚Äôs more! Order now and get a free Ferrari too! Oh it seems our lines are down its too late. They‚Äôre back up again! But it‚Äôs too late! I use too many exclamation marks! But there‚Äôs more! Be the 7.8√ó10^9 customer to order to get a free home with your choice of a happy meal toy! KSHHHHHH . I think that people complain about preservatives way to much. They all say ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs SOOOO unhealthy‚Äù but I think that month-past-the-expiration-date-food is way more unhealthy. The end of that. Goodbye.Do you do two extra languages in school? If so you will know what I mean. Every time I have to study for one language, I ALWAYS remember the word from the other language! Like when I‚Äôm learning Japanese I‚Äôll think what was ‚Äòhow are you‚Äô again? Oh yea, it‚Äôs frickin √áA VA!!! (Sorry if I‚Äôm being too edgy) in section 250q4 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook it states that English is the best language and no one should be forced to learn any other. If they are, they must fill up a bath tub with alpabits which spell out the word that they uttered and eat all of it without any sugar sprinkled on top (NOOOOO). That sounded a little bit clich√©. GO TO THE TUB YOUNG MAN! ok. Well, that‚Äôs all I got for today. See ya! I‚Äôm back here again! Another hour of my life will be wasted in the next few‚Ä¶ Minutes? That previous (the auto correct is so bad on this phone it corrected previous to peeler oohs) sentence made no sense whatsoever. I have a conspiracy for you guys today! (Or 4 U Guys 2Day if I want to sound ‚ÄòHip‚Äô). Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not as long as that Illuminati one (although I was thinking about doing another one of those soon. So stay tuned!). I think school is a scam! Have you ever noticed that everyone says that the government is trying to brainwash people? Well the LAST place you would think to look for that kind of activity is a government-funded learning program! The government is trying to teach people nonsense to make the population stupid. Like when will I ever need to know about the themes and plot devices in To Kill A Mockingbird? Or how to calculate the area under a curve? Or even that in 1812 a war happened that doesn‚Äôt affect me today! They could be teaching us important things, like how to pay bills, how to get a job, how to overthrow the government and all political world leaders for entire globe domination, how to use bendy straws, you know, the IMPORTANT STUFF! (By the way, one of those things was not like the others). That was my conspiracy. I don‚Äôt think that anyone has actually read to this far. I don‚Äôt actually have any proof that anyone has. But if you have, here is proof. A tiny quiz to test how well you really know this LoTeEv. Email all the answers to me atrainbowflufysheep123@gmail.com, for a chance to win a response from me and a chance to tell me what you think of this site!

And you get a prize! If you send me your answers at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, you will get your name mentioned in this LoTeEv? (I mean, if you want). If your like me and have a lonely YouTube channel with five views because you watched it five times, the his is the prize for you! Anyway, enough with that. An i the only person that thinks buying name brand stuff is dumb? People are pretty much PAYING to advertise a company. People want the logo for the company because it looks ‚Äòcool‚Äô. What if you bought a shirt from The Dump? Would you want it to have a ‚ÄòThe Dump‚Äô logo on it? (Actually, I have no idea what point I was trying to make). I once heard a saying: you aren‚Äôt popular if you spend a thousand dollars on a jacket, but you at if the company that makes it spend a thousand dollars for you to wear it. (Now that I think about it i feel like I may have possibly made that up). You get what I‚Äôm saying though? I hope you do. Well, that‚Äôs my stuff for today. See ya! I‚Äôm back! And do I got stuffs to say! Do you personally know ANYONE who uses exercise balls for their intended purpose? Either we play soccer with them, or we bowl with them, or we throw them really hard at people. Now that I think about it for a little bit, what IS an exercise balls intended purpose? I‚Äôll leave that question for you guys to figure out! Have you heard about that new law that teachers are allow to have guns in schools? I don‚Äôt know what your opinion is on that subject, but I think it‚Äôs an awful idea, at least in my school. For reference, here is a clip of a conversation between my construction and my English teacher. I will name the construction teacher mr. Hardy and the English teacher ms. Poema: ‚Äúhey ms. Poema, have you heard about that new ‚Äòteachers are allowed to have guns in school‚Äô law?‚Äù ‚ÄúIn fact I have mr. Hardy‚Äù ‚Äù I can‚Äôt wait to have mine. I‚Äôm gonna get one of the big ones too, so I can take down the whole class in one go.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get one of those little ones that you can hide in your sock‚Äù ‚Äúbut then you‚Äôll have to take down the students one at a time!‚Äù Now I‚Äôm no ‚Äòexpert‚Äô on education, but is it even LEGAL for teachers to say stuff like that? I thought it was funny, but what if there was a new student at school that day, and they thought that the teachers were psychos!?!? The students already there are used to their teachers being like that though. I have more evidence that the teachers here are crazy! One day my brother borrowed a camera from the school, and Mr. Hardy (what a coincidence) had to collect it from him when he was done. Mr. Hardy said that if he didn‚Äôt bring back the camera by tomorrow, he would have to emigrate to a Muslim country where he would be covered from head to toe, and Mr. Hardy would personally be sent from the school board to seek him out and assassinate him! It‚Äôs just a camera, calm down Mr. Hardy. And the NEXT day he went up to him and said he must have brought the camera back, or else he would be hiding in the trenches of Afghanistan!!! And that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt do construction in school (and because I wasn‚Äôt good at it). That‚Äôs enough about my CrAzY life. Bye!!! It‚Äôs been a REALLY long time (like a week). And I just thought of something great. Isn‚Äôt cereal actually a soup? Well now you‚Äôre going to be thinking about that for the rest of your life :). I‚Äôm going to addition to the RFSRQP (the Rainbow FluffySheep Rhetorical Questions Page). Also to be added: Are there more hard things or soft things in the world? What is the average size of a rock? What is the meaning of life? Does nine plus ten truly equal twenty-one? Why do whales have blowholes? What colour is the dress? How long is a Fortnite? How long is a PUBG? How is plastic made from oil? How is oil made from dead stuff? Why do people eat Cheetos if they get that orange dust everywhere? Why do people celebrate pi day but not tau day? These are all important question you need to ask yourself. I know the answer to one of them. It‚Äôs because it sounds like pie, if half of pi was called Kaek, they would probably celebrate It too. I‚Äôm sorry to say guys, but I have finally and truly decided to stop writing this LoTeEv. I have to pursue other things, like my life. Goodbye forever‚Ä¶. ‚Äî ‚Ä¶ APRIL FOOLS!!! HAHAHA! APRIL FOOLS FOOL! Today is April Fools day and I have so many ideas. So far these are my dubious schemes: I have turned only one corner of my brothers Rubik‚Äôs cube to render it unsolvable (the only way is to take it apart), put the movie in the DVD player upside down so it doesn‚Äôt play, and I stole my brothers Easter egg (as I say it now that last one doesn‚Äôt really seem like a prank). But he got me back, because he: put an avocado in the coffee maker, tied a air refreshener to the door so when you open it it sprays everywhere, and threatened me with a knife that turned out to just be a comb. Isn‚Äôt it great? I have a weird family. Hey! We were all LIED to in kindergarten! Remember you teacher always used to say to you ‚Äúremember children, I before E, except after C!‚Äù We‚Äôll you were SCAMMED! Take the word ‚Äòweird‚Äô as an example. See what wrong here!?!? It has the I AFTER E, and not after C! Now if you don‚Äôt trust the school system then I don‚Äôt know what your doing with your brain. You should go on strike! I just fit in the second ‚Äòpiece‚Äô of the puzzle! When I was little, I use to always say ‚Äúif it rhymes its true‚Äù. That was like my motto! And secretly, you could manipulate any sentence to succumb to the malevolent power of that prestigious rule. You could say ‚Äúbroccoli is bad, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!‚Äù But then you could ALSO say ‚Äúice-cream is good, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!‚Äù. See what I did there? I thought that it was GENIUS! Until it got used against me. All I had to do was change the rule to ‚Äúit‚Äôs true if it rhymes, but only sometimes‚Äù. And that worked perfectly. Fun Fact Of The Paragraph: Leicester is actually not pronounced lay-ches-ter. It‚Äôs les-ter. That makes no sense whatsoever! I still thought you would like to know that. I have a great idea! I should talk about my middle school! Ah, way back in the day that was. When I was a wee 13 year old lad. There used to be this bench at the school where people would go to make a friend. I think people were supposed to come and invite them to play a game. But what REALLY happened is that people would just walk past and shout ‚ÄúLoner!!!‚Äù Whenever someone was sitting there. And they were henceforth called ‚Äòthe loner benches‚Äô. It‚Äôs a cruel world we live in. Also, there were bushes with really long leaves that we used to make bows there too. We would tie it to a stick, and then we sharpened another stick to use as an arrow. We must have had five bows and fifty arrows at the time. We hid them all under a tree, so no one would steal them. Until one day, some random person ran in stole a bow and arrow, and SHOT IT AT A TEACHER. And that‚Äôs how THAT ended. Now that I think about this school, I don‚Äôt think we ever really learned anything there. Also, herb is pronounced erb. Weird stuff, right? I have a very important, strange question for you. Why are there so many fast food restaurants that are exactly the same? What‚Äôs the point? Ask yourself that question 5 ‚Äì 7 times a day, 3 ‚Äì 4 times a week, 2 ‚Äì 4 times a month, 12 times a year. ( You can take leap day off if you want ( although if you do you might find yourself in a Burger King contemplating life ( while also contemplating if $3.99 for 6 chicken wings is better than $6.99 for 10 ( and if the ketchup packets are free with a soft drink ( and if you ask that If the employee will look at you with utter bewilderment ( has this ever happened to you? You are squirting your ketchup into your coke when you realise‚Ä¶ How much do I put in!?!? I read on reddit to put 2.3 packets per 7.9 ounces of coke, and a kilogram is 2.2 pounds, so that mean 5.4 packets per kilometre per hour (ppkph) and there is 39 miles in a light nano-second and‚Ä¶ AHHHHHHH!!! Well try the new pre-mixed ketchoke! It has that perfect flavour, time after time! Ketchoke: not copyrighted! ( warning: you might choke))))))). In Europe m&m‚Äôs are actually really healthy. Believe it or not, there are like six vegetables in one bag of m&m‚Äôs. Instead of using dyes like red133 and blue423, they use stuff like beetroots. Isn‚Äôt that amazing / awful depending on what type of person you are. In land of the lost one of the characters is eating a donut filled with m&m‚Äôs and another person asks what he‚Äôs doing. He says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm eating a donut filled with m&m‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt have to eat m&m‚Äôs after I eat my donut‚Äù. I thought you would like to know that fun fact. I have a conspiracy! OWLS ARE TRYING TO MAKE US DUMB! People always say owls are wise! But how wise can someone be who has six toes!!! Six is equal to half a dozen. The reason I think owls are dumb is because I HATE when people say half a dozen. WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME! I AM SO ANGRY AND THAT IS WHY I AM USING CAPITAL LETTERS!!! Half a dozen is FOUR SYLLABLES, and six is only one. So when someone says half a dozen, I just think ‚Äúoh wow, you‚Äôre just TRYING to waste my time‚Äù ‚Äúduring that .5 of a second you spent saying that I could have twiddled my thumbs 3,4 times, or seen every main Naruto character in a 60 FPS environment, or listen to the first two notes of crazy frog‚Äù. Now that I think about it, during the time I made that rant about half a dozen loathing, I could have listened to the first THREE notes of crazy frog (Duh DUH duh. Skip ahead to the chorus of that song.. CRAZY FROG!!!) Hello. I have a topic for you today. I was having a dream and in it there was a pink sticky note. already fascinating! But on it was handwriting‚Ä¶ THAT I COULDNT READ. How could my brain write words that i couldn‚Äôt even read??? Life makes no sense. Or as AntVenom would say; LIFE makes NO SENSE?! Fun fact of the paragraph: 2 to 3 times a week is almost the same as every 2 or 3 days. Wahoo! Next time you buy a freddo or a banana-flavoured-freddo choco bar then remember‚Ä¶ Eat it every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 times a day! (Wait thats not right‚Ä¶) actually ‚Äì JUST EAT YOUR FREDDO!! And now a special announcment: this is a shoutout to the Not Very Helpful Secrets Of Things Corporation! Or the NVHSOTC. Which means nothing. It is a company which makes things like the little tabs at the sides of cling film boxes. No-one knows about these things, but they ‚Äòhelp‚Äô people. Also, they make things like handles on flashlights that double as a stand so the poor little electrons burst into the sky helplessly, uselessly. Without this company, the world would simply not be the same!!! If donate ?5 to this company, or $4.815162342 (i hope those dollars dont get LOST in the mail hehehe) then you can save a turkey from strep throat. The end. GOODBYE!!! If you have made it this far into the official LoTeEv, then you get the official Rainbow FluffySheep Badge of Honour!!! (Um, this isnt a badge‚Ä¶ Its just a piece of plastic with your face on it!! Go ahead, put it on your lappel next to your badge of boy scouts for not being sexist and letting girls into boy scout (speaking of this: they changed Canada‚Äôs national anthem from ‚Äúall thy sons command‚Äù to ‚ÄúAll thy peoples command‚Äù. Why would they do that? Did the ‚Äòa‚Äô REALLY need to be capitalised??) but how can i if there is nothing to stick it with? Would you like a knife perhaps? No, anything else! I haven‚Äôt trusted you with knives ever since you tried to butter your toast and ended up slicing Milly the Cat‚Äôs third whisker to the left. Actually, i don‚Äôt NEED this badge. Don‚Äôt worry! Take this ‚Äì sqquuiisshh ‚Äì (takes gum from mouth (tutti frutti flavour coincidentally (actually not coincidentally because this is fictional and i made it up to emulate the story (and it is altogether irrelevant anyway (some gum says its good for your teeth, so i guess it is coinci-DENTAL! (Hahahaha (the reason i picked tutti frutti is because is is multicoloured like rainbows (as in Rainbow Fluffysheep (pretty smart if (you ask me (now I‚Äôm just adding brackets for no reason)))))))))))) I DONT NEED THE BADGE! Besides, i don‚Äôt even have a lapel. Goodbye! Hello! Do you think that you are a professional guitar player? Well if yes, let me prove you wrong. A professional guitar player can play any children‚Äôs song, right? Well try playing teddy bear picnic! Its total chord count consists of‚Ä¶ Brace yourself ‚Ä¶ SIXTEEN! Bye! Welcome back loyal fan of the Rainbow FluffySheep club! You have been here through my hardest struggles, and my most euphoric discoveries. Merci! Now, onto the real problem at hand‚Ä¶ Pedals! (I guess that would be a problem at foot actually). Car pedals are so wierd because there is a brake, clutch and gas. I always thought that there was a forwards and a backwards! (Well, until like five years ago). Sad how this world has to make simple things so complicated. There must be THOUSANDS of buttons on a plane, when all it needs is up, down, right, left, forwards, backwards, cupholder eject, radio station changer, barrel roll, mince meat dispenser and two parachutes just for the captain because they don‚Äôt care about the passengers. Don‚Äôt you hate it when you are typing a list with commas and you get to the last word of the list and you realise you forgot to put an and before it?!?! E.g. The colours of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (oh no i was supposed to put an and there) indigo AND violet. There ya go, a real FWP (First World Problem (theres so many abbreviations nowadays that eventually theres going to be no words, just abbreviations)). Isn‚Äôt it weird that the ukelele strings aren‚Äôt in order? It goes Ding dong Dong DING. I wonder how that got invented? It was probably some smart guy inventing an ultra-efficient stringed-instumentplaying device when his dumb friend walks up and says what does this knob do? And the he goes BWOWOWOWOW. Yep, i guarantee you thats how it happened. Are you in a car right now and you are bored AND its raining? Pick a raindrop on the window and race it against another one. It‚Äôs great! Or you could just keep reading this, which is probably even MORE great. You could just read this forever. If you ever get to the end, then that means you are reading faster than I‚Äôm typing. Which is actually really easy. Right now I‚Äôm at the end of this LoTeEv. There is nothing but an endless abyss of void past these very words. Until i write more, that is. Do you know what is a great topic to ruin your fail routine? What makes me not sleep at night. And the answer may surprise you‚Ä¶ BLANKETS. Thunk about it. The fully stuff in the inside is FEATHERS. DUCK FEATHERS. They kill the duck!!! Or they just skin him. But have you ever seen a featherless duck?? Exactly. Skinning them would probably be worse then killing them. Thy would be so ashamed to walk in public featherless. Unless they live in a hot country like spain, in which case the featherless ducks are the cool ones. Noooo!!! I just realised that blankets actually are made of weird fluffy stuff, while PILLOWS are made of feathers. So actually pillows are what keep me awake at night. But they also keep me asleep because thats their job. Its a PARADOX!!! Like Shr√∂deners cat. Im always half awake and half asleep at the same time. Although I‚Äôm closer to asleep at school. Because they don‚Äôt have pillows. If you cant sleep, i have a game for you, yes YOU. Scribble on a page, then colour in the spaces with two alternating colours so the colours aren‚Äôt touching. It looks so cool too. I have a consiracy. ICE-CREAM!!! It hurts SO MUCH!!! The government has hidden tiny knives inside of ice-cream to STAB YOUR TEETH! Its eeevil!!! They do this because then dentists get more money, which in turn‚Ä¶ In turn causes the‚Ä¶ the government to‚Ä¶ lose money. Nevermind, this conspiracy has been proven FALSE by the Conspiracys Are Really Stupid commission, or COWS. I guess that would be Weally Stupid. Right now it is al the back in the year 2018. Hello from the distant past! I think ive typed enough for now. Bye!!! Im back! With some more wwiieerrdd things for you! I was casually walking around, doing my own thing, eating a burrito (i actually wasn‚Äôt, but it adds mystery to this tale) when two people walked past me. ‚ÄúWhat you have to is multiply the elephants by five, and divide by three‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, I was so close!‚Äù. Now you reader try to figure out what they were talking about. (Ps: you cant! Hahaha!). And thats what happened today. Woohoo! I‚Äôm so happy. I have overcome my boundaries in c++ three times today. First, i put a function into a header file. Next, i saved multiple pieces of data into one text file. THEN, i saved an array to a text file. Hooray! If you know about c++ then you will be excited for me.

I know what you are thinking. How did you get that much done‚Ä¶ On a school day!? And this is what happened. I was getting up to go to school, like normal when SUDDENLY (Dramatic music) i turned (Dramatic music builds) and saw (Dramatic music at the climax) that i had to leave in ten minutes. (Dont worry, this doesn‚Äôt end up being my fault, or else i wouldnt tell this story). I was ready in ten minutes‚Ä¶ LIKE A BOSS!!! And then i realised‚Ä¶ No-one was driving us to school. Huh. And thats what happened. My parents woke up and two-o-clock. Pm. Like they don‚Äôt care about our education. It was the best day EVER! I coded for five hours. The end of that story, and a word from our sponsor. #Include ‚Äúlifesimulator.h‚Äù void life(socialsecuritynum){ If (youremotion == ‚Äúbored‚Äù && bool havejob == ‚Äúfalse‚Äù){cout << ‚Äúcome and work at the c++ factory, where we code robots to take your job!!!; havejob = true; youremotion = ‚Äúhappy‚Äù;} else {cout << ‚Äúlife is great!‚Äù;}}. do you want to work at ‚Äòstealyourownjob‚Äô? The only problem is that the best employees get fired the fastest. See ya! Guess what my loyal fans‚Ä¶ IM HALFWAY THROUGH THE WORLD RECORD!!! Now, if I really want to win, all i have to do is double the amount of words. Im im halfway halfway through through the the world world record record!!! !!! That would make for a really stupid thing to read though. Has anyone printed this LoTeEv off? Seeing as most novels are 70,000 words or something like that, you my loyal reader, could easily print off 18,500 words. Maybe you could make a coffee table book. Don‚Äôt steal my works and post it on another website (actually, your website is probably too high standard for this nonsense). Every reproduction of this text must have a copyright notice as following: copyrighted and trademarked and patented an registered and stuff to RainbowFluffySheep Ltd. It hereby states in the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook section 123a, b and c that (a) this is the coolest LoTeEv ever (b) cheese is a vegetable and (c) that you may tell your friends about the LoTeEv, so long as the words emitted from your mouth do not consist of up to and include 50% of the total text from which it is derived (i‚Äôd like to see you try though (and id like to see if you have a friend because i need them üò¶ (that would have been really creepy if i wrote ‚ÄòI need them ;)‚Äô ))). Anyway, gotta go, cuz its may the second, and you know what that means‚Ä¶ May the Second be with you!!! Chairs‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre great for sitting in, aren‚Äôt they? Do you remember when fidget spinners were all the rage? Kids all around the globe were spinning plastic toys. And all the adults were like, ‚ÄúWow, those are the most useless toys EVER!!!‚Äù But what i think is that their toys were just as bad! Think about jacks, those little spiky things with the other round things that your throw and bounce them. How is that any better!?!? Anyway, I‚Äôm just saying don‚Äôt be so Judge Judy (which is a great show (because you get to watch that big person swing a meat-hammer at a table (I‚Äôve always wanted to do that))) all the time. Is time really a dimension? Because you can only move forwards in it. Imagine if you coulde only move forwards in the third dimension at the same rate. You would get squished with alot of walls. But, you could go back in time, to make up for the lot dimension. Perfect! I have a new‚Ä¶ CONSPIRACY! You know those pillow where if you put them on one end they are dark and on the other end they are shiny? I think that the government has hidden thousands of tiny cameras facing upwards into the pillows, and the shiny parts are just the lenses for them reflecting light. So if you happen to own any of these said pillows, throw them away!! Or else‚Ä¶ You will be watched. In section 747 of the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook it states that you should cut all the wires coming out of your pillows, because they are probably connected to a van outside your house. If there are no wires, then they are probably using radiowaves; in which case you should insert your pillow into an untainted lead box. Hopefully you don‚Äôt care that your pillow is now heavy, hard, cold and poisonous. You know how adults also say shooting games are ‚ÄúDangerously mind-altering‚Äù? Well i bet in world war two the parents didn‚Äôt say to their kids: ‚Äúhey jimmy?‚Äù ‚ÄúYea, momma?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatcha doin my lad?‚Äù ‚ÄúIm peelin me potaytoes and them I‚Äôm going to feed the cattle‚Äù ‚Äújo i mean with your life‚Äù ‚Äúoh right mam! Im go‚Äôn awf to wawr with my buds!‚Äù ‚ÄúBut war is dangerously mind-altering my sonny-boy!‚Äù ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Ya.‚Äù ‚ÄúIm very disappointed in you. Soon your going to be living in my basement eating fatcakes.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut ma, im fightin for awr country!‚Äù ‚ÄúWar is so violent though!‚Äù ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Ya.‚Äù You get the picture. Teenagers need violence in their lives! If we cant get it by going to war, then either we play violent video-games or we beat strangers!! Which one would you choose NOW, stereotypical adults!!! (See how i slowly increased the exclamation marks to increase the intensity (!!!!)). Also, adults always say stuff like ‚Äúlookie here, cabbage is a new superfood!‚Äù ‚ÄúHowdya know ma?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt what they say nowadays‚Äù ‚Äúwhat time is nowadays ma?‚Äù ‚Äú1945‚Äù (coincidentally the same family apparently) but who‚Äôs ‚Äòthey‚Äô think about that, and listen to how often people say that. I have asked close personal relations and he / she stated that ‚Äúits probably some group of scientists or something in Wisconsin‚Äù. Really? Wisconsin? Thats probably why ‚Äòthey‚Äô say that cheese is unhealthy an im only allowed one laughing cow a day! (You would eat alot too if you got PTSD from a laughing cow (imagine you are just loitering around a fast food shop, eating fillet piggoin (dont ask (it was on sale for half price OK!)) when SUDDENLY a cow sneaks up behind you and makes a 200-Decible half moo half evil laugh (like this: mmwoaohoaohoa))) thats what ‚Äòthey‚Äô sound like. See ya!!! Im back, with a thimble-load of structural wisdom! And my question to you readers is this: is garlic a fruit? Just wondering. I don‚Äôt know what to type! Ahhhhhh! I have typed my mental breakdowns to soothe them. Ahhh. Ahh. Ah. Ahhh!!! Nevermind. You know those shopping carts at stores that cost a quarter? I always went to those to see if anyone left their money in. And i got one once! You should try it. Its so satisfying when you find one. One. Only one. Buy a pencil or something to reward yourself. Make sure its a 6b pencil, so you don‚Äôt put any strain on your eyes. Or your wrist-muscles. I just found the degree button! There is a door open at a 45¬∞ angle that is 45¬∞ Celsius (Its probably in Arizona or something). Do coats keep you warm, or do they preserve heat? I think its the ladder (it is (the ladder i mean (the latter i mean (wait, is it the latte or the ladder? (The former))))) so that means if you put a coat on a snowman it would keep him alive longer! Ill start a new charity; Coats for Melting Snowmen: saving snowmen lives one water droplet at a time!! See yaaaaaaa.:.This is‚Ä¶ A new beginning to the LoTeEv on a new phone! Although it will be added to the original LoTeEv, this part will be a new beginning, a fresh chronicle!!! But don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶ Nonsense is 100% guaranteed! More like 1 üôÇ üôÇ % guaranteed! I just had a scary thought. They say can buy everything, but I know one thing it can‚Äôt buy ‚Äì a trip to the summit of Mount Everest!! No matter what you cant get to the summit unless you climb yourself. Even a helicopter can barely make it to the base camp!! I cant believe humans havent made something to do that yet. Unless‚Ä¶ You could land the ISS on it! Perfect!! That would definetly work. I should make my own subreddit. Before I begin on this wonderful journey, i must inform you, the reader, what a subreddit is. As far as you know, a sub-reddit is just a burger at burger-galaxy (this is the cringiest sci-fi failure youll ever read). He are some examples of subreddits: r/whooooooosh (i cant remember how many o‚Äôs there are) eg. { Joe: this is the best joke ever! ‚Äî Cashier: are you going to pay for that chocolate bar? Customer: I dont have any money üò¶ Cashier: then put it back! Customer: *slides cashier a 20* lets keep this between us üòâ ‚Äî Bob: why didnt he just pay for the chocolate bar? Jim: r/whooooosh }. Next subreddit is: r/atetheonion. Heres the backstory: The Onion is a fake news site, which posts funny news. If you fall for that news, you are said to have ‚Äúate the onion‚Äù. Eg. { The Onion: new studies show that drinking can lower thirst by up to 96% Bob: everyone knows this this is so stupid!!! Jim: r/atetheonion } What am i doing? Why don‚Äôt you just look it up on the internet!?!? r/facepalm I HAVE TO STOP. So my subreddit will be, r/RainbowFluffySheep. Who wouldve thought!?!? In it there will b‚Äî we interupt your normal daily FluffySheep to bring you an urgent news report: farm animals of all kinds are raging across the streets! We cant figure out why; one cameraman suggested they were on strike against meat production practices. I just got word that we will be speaking to a memebr of this protest shortly. Standby‚Ä¶ Ok, so why are you commencing with this protest Sir BaaBaBaaa? Ba ba baa baaa. Baa baaa BAAA!!! Baa ba‚Äî We inturupt this interuption to bring you back your regulary scheduled program. ‚Äî ‚Äî we at FluffySheep Studios dont care about animal protests! We will eat all the beef jerky we want! Right guys! Guys! *sniffling in the background. A slight whimper. A deep voice. A thickened plot.* Actually [unknown], we have all been deeply moved by the actions these animals are taking. Thus‚Ä¶ We have all become vegans. *[unknown]‚Äôs mind is blown (thats me by the way)* well‚Ä¶ I gues ill eat this beef jerky by myself then. *crinkles the packet*. Many evil stares. *Pulls it open*. Someone starts pounding his fists. *Takes out a jerky*. Someone comes over very close ‚Äì so close you could smell the vegan on him. My heart is beating. What will happen to me if i eat this beef jerky!? Or worse.. If i dont. Will i become one of them!? Thats a risk im just not willing to take. Ba bum. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Brings the jerky towards his mouth*. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Opens his mouth*. Everyone from around the building is now watching him. BA BUM. BA BUM. *chew* Find out what happens next time on‚Ä¶ The LoTeEv ‚Äî Animals Strike ‚Äì in more ways than one!! Im back! And today I‚Äôm going to be talking about a very different scenario. I need to talk more about real life conspiracies if i need to keep my readers interested!! And these may not just be conspiracies, mind you, but a new kind of segment for my beloved reader(s) (i read this, sooooo) called learning about scams and trying to use them to trick my readers into reading more! So i heard about this new scam( never mind its actually old( like your mother( i‚Äôm hilarious, i know( and possibly quite offensive))) where you get say ten people to each give you ‚Ç¨10, and you give them ¬£15 back. ( i‚Äôm just going explain this now, but throughout this demonstration i‚Äôm going to be changing the currency symbol for comedic effect, but now that i think about it, explaining it ruins what little comedic effect what there at all, but i‚Äôm going to keep all of this anyways : ] ) And then you get 20 people to give you $20 each and you give them ¬•30 back. And THEN You get 100 people to give you @100 each and you don‚Äôt pay them back! What a plan! You get to keep &10,000 in the end, which i think is a great idea. Bu how could i do that with words, you may ask? Leave your question in the comments down below ( and also your answer to your comments because a busy writer like me doesn‚Äôt heed to your delusion of getting a response from an esteemed author and self-published poet of sorts) and keep reading, because i have a possible solution. Just replace the money with characters randomly typed by an assistant writer named bilbo ( yes, he is a money of course, we need these characters to be truly random, i cant count on technology‚Äôs ‚Äòthis is random because we get extremely precise measurements of radiation‚Äô shtick anymore ). While you try to figure out how that would ever work, ill be swiftly moving on to a new, more exciting and reasonable topic, such as‚Ä¶ figure out the movie!! There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The cat‚Äôs face has a striking similarity to that of leonardo de caprio. The mat is a dream. The mat is another cats mat. The mat, when opened, contains another mat inside. Both mats are very real depictions of a real mat, but are both not real. Somehow, another mat is inside the second mat. Most cats thought that this was impossible. There is a cat named joe who owns a bowl filled with a dry collection of the most cat food in the house, which goes by the name of KittyNibbles. When joe dies, he leaves his son, who is still just a kitten named bob, the entire bowl of KittyNibbles. Joe must decide whether to eat the bowl of KittyNibbles, by pouring milk on the food, liquidating it into a scrumptious snack, or keeping to dry KittyNibbles for others and future kitten alike. Another kitten, a fairly shrewd manx cat called ‚ÄòThe Black Paws‚Äô was hired by another cat, who has a large portion of KittyNibbles himself. The problem for the hiring cat, a tabby named ‚ÄòFluffball‚Äô, is that his large supply isn‚Äôt vast enough to outweigh bobs, making it the second largest collection of KittyNibbles in the whole house. The reason Fluffball needs to hire BP is to convince Bob that Joe would‚Äôve wanted him to eat his nibbles, because of it‚Äôs great nutritional value. If he does eat it, the Fluff would have a monopoly of sorts on his selling of KNibbles for toys such as tons of rubber mice. To convince Bob that thats what Joe wouldve wanted, they set up a trick where they make a puppet of Joe talking to Bob, and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words, to liquidate the KittyN‚ÄôS. The thing is, the puppet of Joe is made of two mats stuck together, but there is a problem. Bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really Joe, because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat. Team BP knows that this has to work first time, so they found the technology they needed, a third mat. But when stiching the mats together, BP realised that he has lice and termites in his fur, which are eating away at the mats. He need to find another cat who doesn‚Äôt have termites who can sew as good as he can. The plot thickens‚Ä¶.. While you figure that out, i‚Äôll be sleeping, see ya : ) ///// I will not explain: ‚Äî‚Äì There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The cat‚Äôs name? Leonardo de Caprio. The mat is a dream.

But I‚Äôll finish it later. right now there‚Äôs something even more important: Ink cartridges are such a scam! Such a scam! A scam! For multiple genius reasons. First of all, as you know, it costs around $60 to buy a single ink cartridge!! Guys‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve changed alot ok‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs new thing i gotta say‚Ä¶ This is like a new year for me‚Ä¶ Not even, a new era‚Ä¶ A 2.0 on existence. So get ready for a new and improved loteev! First let‚Äôs start off with this,for you this isn‚Äôt a new and improved loteev! I caught you! U just skipped ahead to this part cos you couldn‚Äôt be bothered to read all the way here. But believe me, I sure don‚Äôt blame you. It was kinda lame. Now, as a moderner child with new skills in awesomeness, I‚Äôm wayy smarter thus making this better for reading. But also sadly more boring as well‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs start then. What is there to talk about?? Muchos! First of all let‚Äôs just say that this loteev is getting really long. And I know I‚Äôve been saying that the whole time, but now it‚Äôs serious. I think I have a problem. What am I actually doing? I‚Äôm not going to be posting this anywhere, cos I don‚Äôt want to pay for a domain name, and my wix site isn‚Äôt exactly going ‚Äòviral‚Äô and the kids say these days. One day it will tho, hopefully. Once I beat the world record I‚Äôll be world renowned for being one of the greatest writers alive!everyone will know my name, from abe link to tommy ed. Even tho they‚Äôre both in the past, my name will be remembered for thousands of years, and time travellers will go back to their time just to tell them about me! Won‚Äôt that be great! And also by the way, if you didn‚Äôt already realise, tommy might be the biggest sham in all of existence. He stole his idea from other peeps and just patented them as his own‚Ä¶ What a loser amirite??!? Ok also I have this new thing to show u guy(s) that ur going to love! It‚Äôs a poem written by yours truly, the something of sheep? Oh gosh no I can‚Äôt remember cos I haven‚Äôt done this in so long, I guess I‚Äôll have to go back and check my old ones‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna be honest guys, I‚Äôm neglecting you. Your being left in the rain and cold, with your only joys the sliver of sunshine piercing through the clouds to dry your soul, drowned in the sorrowful realisation that the loteev will never come close to it‚Äôs original glory, like rome, the empire of the fluffysheep has fallen to a disgrace. I only come outside to feed you guys with my knowledgr every couple of months and it‚Äôs sickening, I‚Äôm ashamed. But I have an umbrella for you of new content, so here we go. First of all, the whole ‚Äúkittens are inceptional‚Äù thing was a sham. I didn‚Äôt finish and I‚Äôm ashamed.. The whole ink cartrige rant? It was like 4 sentences‚Ä¶ My need for the sharing of anger has diminished and I‚Äôm disgusted at what I‚Äôve become. So here I go again, my 2.1 era has been born. It will be remembered for its greatness, just as Rome 2.1 was (italy?). Here‚Äôs the first order of business. I‚Äôll admit I haven‚Äôt read anything about my rainbow fluffysheepness in forever, and thus I am unable to remember literally anything about it. Therefore, I‚Äôm surprised a new citizen hasn‚Äôt taken my place. No-one has yet challenged my loteev for being the longest one yet, and I‚Äôm disappointed in your lack of vigor. If one of you were to challenge me, I will mount my mighty steed and charge my lance into your face. This may seem a little harsh and slighty morbid, so I‚Äôll tone it down. We will each send a ghost-copy of ourselves instead of us! You know in racing games when there‚Äôs another vroom-vroom machine and he‚Äôs blue, opaque and always does better? Like thay but with people. So here‚Äôs what I propose: I will take my ghost-sword from my -ghost sheath and ghost-chop your ghost into tiny little ghost-pieces (from now on I hereby declare that saying ghost everytime is unnecessary and annoying, so by the something something big number letters blah blah of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook, ghost will be shortened to ?. This is to make sure no dirty imposters try to type up my 95 these of ? Fighting, if u see the word ‚Äòghost‚Äô beware! It is a hoax and a sham and a scam and spam and all that jazz ( I highly doubt that all of the times I‚Äôll write the word ‚Äòghost‚Äô in the future will add up to the length of this bracketry)). Anyways, I will cut up your ?person so much that I will separate it into individual molecules, and each molecule will be equally spread across the surface of the earth. My lance, ‚Äòthe diffuser‚Äô, will be hailed across the nation as a Excalibur 2.0, people will come from all over the world to take part in sand splitting competitions, where you have to see how many sand grains you can slice in under a minute. I‚Äôm really liking this whole medieval themed loteev that‚Äôs been happening lately. Anyways, I‚Äôve decided to get a pet. A dog or a cat you may ask, to which I would say ‚Äònah fam‚Äô. Something more exotic? A parakeet or a marmot? To that I would say ‚Äòah sure your getting closer lad‚Äô. The answer? A circle. It‚Äôs that simple. A circle doesn‚Äôt need to get fed, it doesn‚Äôt bark, and most importantly it doesn‚Äôt need to be taken on walks! You just let it go at the top of a hill and it walks itself üôÇ my circle can only talk in circles, or ovals too since it speaks multiple language. I will one day go back and make a dictionary / translation table for ? ( it‚Äôs name is ? ok) but for now he will just say gibberish. {O√∂√ñ0.¬∞:} what does that mean?? I don‚Äôt know, I haven‚Äôt had him for long enough to understand :/ I‚Äôm back my fellow seekers of entertainment! This has become a novel comparable to that of Tolkien, and a diary nearing the classicism of anne frank. The sheer bulk of these writing is enough to make non-english speakers weep at the sight of it. I‚Äôm wondering as I type whether my newfound political correctness is appreciated amongst you, I don‚Äôt recall completely but this tome used to contain blatant racism and sexism to the highest degree. I‚Äôve decided to recant my ways and become a fully PC quizmaster!! Helllllo and welcome to my show! First question: in what year were the 1960 Olympics held? This is for the big jackpot of $1,000,000,000! Oh, 1960 you say? That‚Äôs correct! I just lost all my money, I‚Äôll be in debt forever me my life is terrible now! Circcy, tell them how much they won! {000.000.000}. Hmmm nothing u say? that‚Äôs cheap! Well thanks for joining us today ladlies and gentlementle! Hope you had an _equisite_ evening‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Were going back to our roots here. Ive read back over a little bit of the start of this loteev‚Ä¶ and I used to be so much more alive. I had the potential to be a new york times number one bestseller, topping the charts with my childrens books. In my young and untrained eyes I thought of sam as a threat, hiding around the corner with a water gun, ready to splash me with another 1000 words of texts just as I was about to pull ahead. I then realised that the website is like 15 years old‚Ä¶ but at least that makes it alot easier for me to beat her, right? no. I have changed for the worse. Im now but a frail old man with a typpewriter, penning his prose to the sky hoping that some flaming chicken somewhere will read this, and I can form these words to a cane and bop her upside the head with it. But alas, I have not a strong bone left in my body. Maybe its time to pass these texts on to a worthy succesor. Something you may not realise is that this is the 1st anniversary (yes I did just spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell anaversaree) so Ive been writing this for a year. most distinguished authors would have published their books by now, but Im too scared of the publics opinion. Anyways, Im going to get back to my old self. *ring ring ring* hey wazzup *whos this ahhaha ehehe* its your future self boi.

I am the Greatest Shearer of Sheep Himselfs security system. Where did you get the number 946607 from? Bzzt* Ummm It‚Äôs my favourite number! *Bzzt my system says that that number has no significance. It is a suspiciously random number. Did you generate it with a random number generator? Bzzt* Yess fine I admit it, it‚Äôs not even a good number, maybe if I put it into hex it‚Äôs a good color though‚Ä¶ Oh no no no that‚Äôs literally the worst color I‚Äôve ever seen BLEGH *Bzzt The real Shearer would never pick a random number! therefor I am kicking you out Bzzt* A portal opens in the floor beneath our antagonist and he is sucked out into space üôÇ Hey guys I‚Äôm back now! What happened when I was gone? *Bzzt Nothing Bzzt* Circcy? Do you know what happened? Securitee where is Circcy!! *Bzzt Securitee does not know Bzzt* Huh, maybe it has to do with this portal in the floor‚Ä¶ wwwoowowooohohohohohoaohaoahahahhahhahhahhhhhhhahahahahahaaahahhhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. IM IN SPACE HELPPPP ‚Äî Our portagonist is in grave danger! what is going to happen next? Find out next time on your favourite show, The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death (Exurb1a). now watch a few ads. Do you lack the farming equipment of your dreams? have you always wanted to be a shepherd but sheep taste too good you just can‚Äôt stop yourself from eating your herd? Well then this is good news for you! New FluffySheep Astronaut Suits are so tuff that you‚Äôll never be able to eat through! Just hire one of are many Sheep Protection Officers to put them on for you üôÇ Do you ever hate your boss? Does he do things such as tell you what to do, pay you minimum wage (which is what you should be getting paid but your still salty about it), and eat you alive? Get the new FluffySheep Astronaut Suit to protect you from your shepherd! Baa ba bab abaa baaa aaaba, ababa baa baab (ba ababa bbaa ab), aa bba ba? Baa ab baa abbb! Wellllllcome back to The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death ‚Ñ¢! AHHAHAH I‚Äôm literally dyinggg oh hey circcy! what are you doing here? {0o‚Ä¶0} He did!? That scumbag has always been trying to take my spot as the Supreme Leader Of The Fluffiest Of Sheep!! I‚Äôll get him don‚Äôt worry circcy, I‚Äôll throw you back through the portal *toss*. Now where is he? Ah I see him behind that planet over there, I‚Äôll just boomerang over to him *shoop* Hey Imposter Boy! Let me show you who‚Äôs the real shepherd! *I smack him with my amazing shepherd cane and he shoots into the nearest star*. Now I‚Äôll just boomerang back to the portal andddd *shoop* I made it back Circcy! Are you proud of me? {o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0} But‚Ä¶ he was bad! He deserved it! I‚Äôm sorry I didnt want him to die üò¶ Anyways I‚Äôll go write this in my diary, because I have had quite a day today. And he I am now, reader! I just did all of those cool things for realz and I‚Äôm not even lying! {0.ooo} *whispers* Shuuuup little circle *rolls him out of the room* Anyways ignore what he said he didnt mean it üôÇ I‚Äôve decided to be real here reader. The only person reading this is me üò¶ at least that means I can get reeeeeeeeal personal with all this stuff üòâ Anyways so typing this is making me hackin dizzy so I have like writers block but for sickness.. writers stock of chicken soup for the soul? Yes that sounds about right. I‚Äôm also practicing typing in real typing ehich I can‚Äôt remember the nam of but it makes b=me sick but I‚Äôm getting real real fast. I know during the early days of this I had immense trouble trying to spell ‚Äòpiplup‚Äô but it‚Äôs even harder now with one hand touch-typing. Did you know that lemons look exactly like oranges when they are peeled? I know this because after an hour of trying with a breadknife and lots of blood it looks very similar. But if oranges are called oranges because they are orange then lemons should be called red because they are red. Wait, that might be the blood actually *rub rub* oh wow yes they‚Äôre yellow so they should be called yellows. . Let‚Äôs make a list: Red = tomato, orange = orange, yellow = lemon, green = apple (I know I know the red apple people are going to start a riot (I actually prefer red apples so what have I done (Pink Ladies for life (Grease reference?))), blue = blueberry, indigo = blueberry, purple = blueberry (that won‚Äôt get confusing at allllll). Guys I‚Äôm gonna tell you the truth: We‚Äôre at 24,500 words! *Bzzt drop the confetti Bzzt* *confetti drops* Thanks Securitee! That means we are 70% the way to the world record! I‚Äôm actually pretty proud. At the rate I‚Äôve been going I‚Äôll be done by like september 2020. If you‚Äôre reding this after that date and you haven‚Äôt beat the record, shame on you! I‚Äôm gonna do some quick maffs. If I type one word per secoond, then I can type 3600 words in an hour. Wait, that can‚Äôt be right???? That means that I could technically beat the record in like 4 hours. I am so confused!? How could I possibly have so few words?? My mind is literally blown right now. I‚Äôm gonna check how much I‚Äôve written just today. I‚Äôve done 1,000 words today! Why do I only have 24,000 words then?? I guess I‚Äôll never know. I could‚Äôve easily beat the world record in only a month if I really tried. But this isn‚Äôt realllly about beating the record, it‚Äôs more about impacting the reader as a person. I want this to really change your perspective on life, and maybe make you want to do one of these too! They‚Äôre like diaries but less boring to write and read. And they don‚Äôt tell you anything about The Writer‚Äôs life. So theyre nothing like diaries at all I guess. I‚Äôm gonna do a quick typing speed test to see how fast I reallly can type. I just did a test and it called me an octopus, getting 45 wpm. There was a notification that came up halfway through so I‚Äôll see if I can get to 60wpm. Ok I‚Äôm back, and I‚Äôm also less of a man than I was. I used to have amibition and drive to become the greatest, but i only got to 46wpm. I don‚Äôt know what to do guys. I‚Äôm having an existential crisis about my LoTeEv, because it‚Äôs not nearly the quality it once was. I mean it wasn‚Äôt that great before but now all I talk about is meta stuff about the LoTeEv, which I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good content or not? I guess I‚Äôll never find out. Now we are going really meta. let‚Äôs goooooo ‚Äî You walk into a room‚Äî the walls are covered in a strange green slime, while the room is cracked open to reveal sunlight pouring in. the floor to the ceiling is covered in vines and brush. You even see a nest in one of the vines, with a beautiful hummingbird floating above it. You walk down the hallway in front of you, and when you turn right you see something amazing. An infinite hallway with doors going down forever. a sign on the first door says META, you open the door and ffaallllll iiiinnnssiddeeee‚Ä¶.. ^-^[welcome to meta! my name is Tune and ill be your guide through these halls. through the first window to your left you‚Äôll see the LoTeEvs roots‚Äô] You look up to see that the thing talking to you is.. a hummingbird! The same one that you saw earlier! Ahh this makes sense now, NEST, as in META. You also look through the window to see a giant open room filled with twisted root from a towering tree in the center. on the top is a ball of flames anthrpomorphised with the eyes of a dragon staring downward. They‚Äôre looking at a small humble goat, with a bell around it‚Äôs neck and devouring the bushes that still scatter the floor. after a few minutes of eating the plants, hee looks up and sees the flaming ball. He gets a strange look in his eye: Ambition. The flaming ball isn‚Äôt a threat to him, it‚Äôs a challenge. he digs his hooves into the tree trying to climb it, and that‚Äôs when you notice a slight shake in the ground. ^-^ [come on! there‚Äôs so much more to see! you can come visit anytime too] You say that you‚Äôll come back soon, and tune whistles to goodbye to you.‚Äî Wow.. reader.. I just had the craziest dream let me tell you about it. Wait, I already did? How do you know what it was about, I never said anything, strange. Anyways, I just woke up, I better get back to typing my LoTeEv. I open my laptop to find that while I was asleep words had been typed into my loteev, that‚Äôs strange. There‚Äôs also some mud on my keys?? What is this? Did someone break in? If they did, why would they type in my LoTeEv for me?? I walk over to the living room to see if there‚Äôs any signs of a break-in, and sure enough one of my windows is open! Aha! Wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no sign of forced entry, only a tiny animal coud fit through this window‚Ä¶ Tune? Could it be? Was my dream‚Ä¶ Real? The only person that could‚Äôve known about my dream is tune, she was watching me the whole time. Reader? Do you have any information that I didn‚Äôt get? I am very confused‚Ä¶ I guess I have to get back to writing my LoTeEv though, so I shuffle back to my laptop and sit down. Helllo I‚Äôm back! The strangest thing just happened and there‚Äôs a strange chill in the air‚Ä¶ huh. I would tell you about it, but for some reason‚Ä¶ I think you already know. Ok anyways, typing these Capital Letters At The Start Of Sentences Is Super Annoying. So section 311619 says that the Rai- \{Bzzt what does that number mean Bzzt\} Oh don‚Äôt worry, it is really me! It‚Äôs just the letters in CAPS, can I continue please? Yes? Perfect. Section 311619 of the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook STATES that capital letters must only be used when emphasising GREATNESS, like the LOYAL READERS OF THE LoTeEv (ooh and also apostrophes) . perfect, that was getting annoying. wait, if LoTeEv is only half caps, then does that mean that this is only half great?? huh i didnt mean to do that, strange. its almost like‚Ä¶ someoe from the future knew i would make that rule. wait‚Ä¶ Tune only talks like the new rule i just made which means shes from the future! she is following the rule because it applies to her in the future‚Ä¶ i dont know the repercussions of creating a time-travelling hummingbird but i hope that it is a good bird and will do no harm. sometimes i think that as The Shepherd Of The Sheep Of The Future i sometimes need an escape from my own reality, so I‚Äôve made a tunnel in which i can travel to a blank universe or travel back to this one. it involves stacking portals so that i fall through them, going faster than light, thus travelling to the time before i created all of this. k, im going to go forward now. 3‚Ä¶ 2‚Ä¶ 1‚Ä¶ (((>))) well did that work? i definitely didnt go backwards or else my rainbow fluffysheep laws wouldnt apply and id have to do caps still. wait, let me try something. tune. at the time im at right now, tune doesnt exist, or else that would be caps. which eaither means she is from a less distant future than this one, or‚Ä¶ she died. i really hope the former. anyways, this time is strange. it feels empty, yet familiar. not empty enough. i want to travel across to a new dimension, because this one still has.. reminents of my old one, and it feels‚Ä¶ wrong somehow. ill just pull out my dictionary and check the definition for the fifth dimention: THE 5TH DIMENSION DOES EXIST IN THIS UNIVERSE BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD. interesting, well i guess i better create it then, because it would be very useful. first ill pop back in time (((<))) section 55555 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the fifth dimension should exist, with code-accessible layers. securitee? make that code for me please, thank you. now ill just pop back (((>))) perfect. man its gonna be hard to put this LoTeEv back in chronological order to get it to you reader, but ill try my best. also, when i read that dictionary, did it say that i already have the 5th dimension? because since the timeline changed that would make sense for you wouldnt it. anyways, im just gonna pull out my code files and learn how to go to a new fifth dimension. k im back. (((new-layer=1))) perfect, the default layer is 0. in the manual it said that i auto reset back to my original time and layer everytime i come back to type, which means if i want to come back here ill have to manually do it, shame. i could ask securitee to change that one day, but for now im ok with it. oh guys i almost forgot to tell you! this new layer looks awesome. its completely blank, theres no forces acting on me. its not even white or black like you would expect, but its more‚Ä¶ nothing. imagine if you were blind, alot like that. actually even better, look out of one of your eyes, and your seeing colors and objects. now close it. what are you seeing out of it? Blackness? Whiteness? neither actually, just‚Ä¶ nothing. its strange like that. also, with no forces acting on me, im just kind of‚Ä¶ floating. hopefully this doesnt permanently damage my spine or anything when i get back to gravity. ill be back tomorow and try some stuff in here, bye! I‚Äôm back now, it is the day after and i feel great! there is one thing that i noticed though‚Ä¶ an empty blank canvas might seem great at the start, but you have to realise, most of the art and interesting things that people have created were to overcome a struggle, in fact i would even stretch it to all art that humans have created. Artists may have starting painting to fill the struggle of boredom, and believe me you should take that struggle seriously, because without humans would have accomplished much, much less. you probably could stay at home all day and live of the dole and eat cheetos and live a reasonable life, but why dont you? because you know that you would eventually get bored. boredom leads to jobs, which lead to progression as a species. lets get back to my example then, shall we? you may start art out of the struggle of boredom, continue getting better out of the struggle of wealth, when you realise that hobbies can be monetised your life outcmoe could really change. once your making money as an artist, enought o survive happily and feed your pets and help your family then you keep making art‚Ä¶ why? because you go back to the struggle of boredom again. im still at the first stage of this, which is boredom. i decided to start this because i was bored, and for now thats how this continues. this LoTeEv may never become monetized, but maybe my future writings will. i would guess that 99% of artists never make it to the second stage. 99% of people continue their lives serving either the human race through work, or maybe evn other peoples hobbies and art. but the few 1% of us that end of turning what we love into our livelihoods, the number is fleeting. with big companies monopolising on everyone, buying other companies and merging, the chances for starting you own company is fleeting. why do i tell you this? because i couldnt decide what to do in my new fifth dimension layer. the only struggle for me there was boredom. and alot of the time, that isnt enough. i could imagine anything i wanted there. but why think up the cistine chapel when there‚Äôs no-one to share the experience of seeing it with you, and there‚Äôs no pain in doing it? anyone could think up something beautiful, but not everyone could put it into practice. if everyone could, the world would be oversaturated with perfect music, perfect paintings, and perfect design. does that sound worse or better than today? no humans could ever create such a supply of these things, only ai could. once we have ai surpassing humans at art (i suggest listening to battles ‚Äì mirrored to see what humans think about ai) people will lose all will to live, wouldnt they? theres no chance to succeed at anything creative in such an oversaturated environment, just like my analogy before with the monopoly companies. maybe having a few great albums, a few great paintings to admire and to inspire us that one day we could do that, maybe thats enough. the reason i tell you this is to make you appreciate the ties we are in now. go draw a terrible looking dog, go play some chords on your old guitar you havent played for years, trying your best to sing, go write a poem about what matters to you now, because god knows youll need to read it ten years from now when you start getting nostalgic about the past. take the time to enjoy the era we are in now. i think we can all agree that we are in the best time so far in human history, the least painful, evil generation yet. but i propose that we may be in one of the best eras ever. the future, full of perfect ai creating, doing everything humans do now, but better. well just be remebered to them as the precursor, the comma from nothing to perfection. and once we get to that point, the hedonic treadmill kicks in. what can really bring us joy once we get to that point? why would i be writing this is an ai could write it infinitely better? why would you learn the guitar when an ai can play a perfect Tune? once we get to that stage, the only thing that we will have will be eachother. why learn the guitar? to show your friends! to play them a song, and too have them paint your pet. sharing our experiences wont be taken over by ai, with people reminicent about the past wanting to support people. i, for one, would rather listen to a song about someones life struggles, rather than a perfect song written by an ai. why? because listening to music isnt just about the instruments, the notes, the melody. its about the story. thee basic humans connections that we need to survive. have you ever wanted to buy something from your local shop instead of amazon because you wanted to support them, rather than a large cmopany? im bringing it back to this analogy because i think its nearly identical. the monopolous companies seem to us right now like one big robot using our money to grow. just like the ai. but the problem is, the human desire and greed for more will never surpass our desire to help others. if everyone bought from their local shop, amazon would go out of business, but it hasnt. im not trying to make you guilty for supporting them, because most people depend on the money they save to survive. but what about when ai and robots have completely automated everything? then, by all means, pay a dollar for your neighbors book, rather than the free encyclopedae spit out by your local auto-bookshop. because if were going to be happy, we need eachother. because in the end, thats all well have. anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. just enjoy your life i guess. for now. cause if your under half the average age, its statistically going to get worse üôÇ maybe i need to add struggle to my new layer was my point. or else the entities inside will get bored. wait. maybe this is how earth was created? people always ask why theres pain and struggle in our world, and the answer is normally to advance our species, which is true. but what if the person that created us has access to everything, and they dont want to give it to us because they want us to not get bored? just a thought. anyways, im going to go feed my circle, bai!</p>

            EPISODE VII

         THE FORCE AWAKENS



Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
his help in restoring peace and justice to
the galaxy.

Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

CUT TO BLACK.

A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

ARE IN:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

QUIET:

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
native animals. A single wind chime.
Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
orange and white, this is BB-8.
Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

ROLLS OFF FAST --

INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

LOR SAN TEKKA
This will begin to make things right.
I've traveled too far, and seen too
much, to ignore the despair in the
galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
be no balance in the Force.

POE
Well, because of you now we have a
chance. The General's been after
this for a long time.

LOR SAN TEKKA
"The General." To me, she's royalty.
Well, she certainly is that.

POE
BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
Tekka.

POE (CONT'D)
We've got company.

EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

POE
You have to hide.

LOR SAN TEKKA
You have to leave. Go!
Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
BB-8 follows.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
are HIT!

EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT

Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

POE
Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

IN THE DISTANCE.
Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
But just then:
Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

POE (CONT'D)
I see 'em!
BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
They're in trouble.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

POE
You take this. It's safer with you
than it is with me. You get as far
away from here as you can. Do you
hear me?
(BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
I'll come back for you! It will be
alright.




BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
from cover.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
the battle.

AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --

LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
through the chaos toward San Tekka.
A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

HIM:

SENIOR TROOPER
Stay here.
Our Trooper nods.
Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

KYLO REN
Look how old you've become.

LOR SAN TEKKA
Something far worse has happened to
you.
Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
stormtroopers.

KYLO REN
You know what I've come for.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
I know where you come from. Before
you called yourself Kylo Ren.

KYLO REN
The map to Skywalker. We know you've
found it, and now you're going to
give it to the First Order.
Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
Tekka exchange continue.

LOR SAN TEKKA
The First Order rose from the dark
side... you did not.

KYLO REN
I'll show you the dark side.

LOR SAN TEKKA
You may try, but you cannot deny the
truth that is your family.
Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --

YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --

KYLO REN
You're so right.
And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT

OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.

POE
So who talks first? You talk first?

KYLO REN
The old man gave it to you.

POE

(INDICATES KYLO'S

MASK)
It's just very hard to understand
you with all the...







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN

(TO TROOPERS)
Search him.

POE
... Apparatus.
The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
Poe just glares as the pat down ends.

STORMTROOPER #1
Nothing, sir.

KYLO REN
Put him on board.
Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-

CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
Sir, the villagers.

KYLO REN
Kill them all.
Phasma nods, steps forward:

CAPTAIN PHASMA
On my command!
The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.

CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
Fire!
Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
ours.
Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
he's doomed.
Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing,

BACKS AWAY:





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

STORMTROOPER #2
Nothing here. Go ahead!
Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing --
destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
going.
In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
frightened.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports
and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT

Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the
hangar. He is awed by the imposing space.

POE
All right. All right!
Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his
helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR
THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
in this moment, terrified, desperate.
After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
knows he's in trouble.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
FN-2187. Submit your blaster for
inspection.

FN-2187
Yes, Captain.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
And who gave you permission to remove
that helmet?

FN-2187
I'm sorry, Captain.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
Report to my division at once.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.

CUT TO:

INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY

A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER

Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
HARD onto rusty metal.

INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY

The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY

The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
tiny from here.
Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
engine and DRIVES OFF.

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

SPACESHIPS.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
Refueling, small trade, scavengers.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
her speeder toward the town.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY

TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
some salvage.
Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
language. She returns to work.

INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

UNKAR
What you've brought me today is
worth... Hmmm... One quarter
portion.
Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
She takes it.
She swallows her resentment and heads off.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY

She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
plate. Grabs the loaf.

EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.



(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: just 'cause.
Puts it on,
WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

REY
Tal'ama parqual!
The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

REY (CONT'D)
Parqual zatana!
A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
a tennis match.
Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
says, fiercely:

REY (CONT'D)

NOMA.
The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

REY (CONT'D)
Shhhh.
BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

REY (CONT'D)
That's just Teedo. Wants you for
parts. He has no respect for anyone.
Your antenna's bent.
(considers BB-8 for
the first time,

STRAIGHTENS THE

ANTENNA)
Where do you come from?

(BB-8 BEEPS)
Classified. Really? Me too. Big
secret.
(points to horizon)
Niima Outpost is that way, stay off
Kelvin Ridge.

(MORE)



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY (CONT'D)
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in
the north, you'll drown in the sand.
(stands, heads off)


BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.





REY (CONT'D)
Don't follow me. Town is that way.
(he BEEPS again)
No!
She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

REY (CONT'D)
In the morning, you go.

(HE BEEPS)
You're welcome.
The two disappear behind a dune.

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up.

KYLO REN
I had no idea we had the best pilot
in the Resistance on board.
Comfortable?
Through battered lips:

POE
Not really.

KYLO REN
I'm impressed. No one has been able
to get out of you what you did with
the map.

POE
Might wanna rethink your technique.
Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in
the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching
him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --

KYLO REN
Where is it?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

POE
The Resistance will not be intimidated
by you.

KYLO REN
Where... is it?
Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:

INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce,
confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him:

KYLO REN
It's in a droid. A BB unit.

GENERAL HUX
Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll
soon have it.

KYLO REN
I leave that to you.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

BB-8 is dropped to the sand.

REY
Don't give up. He still might show
up. Whoever it is you're waiting
for. Classified. I know all about
waiting.
BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.

REY (CONT'D)
For my family. They'll be back.
One day. Come on.
She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads
off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.

INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window.
He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.

UNKAR
These five pieces are worth... Let
me see here... One half portion.

REY

(OBJECTS)
Last week they were a half portion
each.
She hates him. He leans forward.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

UNKAR
What about the droid?

REY
What about him?

UNKAR
I'll pay for him.
BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.

UNKAR (CONT'D)
Sixty portions.
CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of
food, her stomach practically rumbles.
BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this
conversation at all.
She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
Finally, she hears herself say:

REY
Actually... the droid's not for sale.

(TO BB-8)
Come on.
Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:

UNKAR
Follow the girl and get that droid.
He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

The cell door WHOOSHES OPEN -- a STORMTROOPER enters. Poe
remains shackled, worse for wear. A TROOPER GUARD here.

STORMTROOPER
Ren wants the prisoner.
TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him.

INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

An exhausted, handcuffed Poe is walked down the corridor by
the Stormtrooper, who holds a blaster at Poe's body.

STORMTROOPER
Turn here.
Poe turns into a narrow passageway --

INT. STAR DESTROYER NARROW PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Heading down the narrow hall the Stormtrooper stops Poe.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

STORMTROOPER
Listen carefully: you do exactly as
I say, I can get you out of here.

POE

(COMING TO)
If -- what--?
The Stormtrooper pulls off his helmet: IT IS FN-2187.

FN-2187
This is a rescue, I'm helping you
escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter?

POE
You with the Resistance--?!

FN-2187
What?

(THAT'S CRAZY)
No no no! I'm breaking you out.
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

POE
I can fly anything. Why, why are
you helping me?

FN-2187
Because it's the right thing to do.

POE
(it hits him)
You need a pilot.

FN-2187
I need a pilot.
And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile.

POE
We're gonna do this.

FN-2187
(unsure but hopeful)
... Yeah?

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY

WIDE SHOT ESTABLISHING the hangar. Find FN-2187, again
masked, walking with Poe. By all appearances he's escorting
a prisoner. A group of OFFICERS passes in the opposite
direction.

FN-2187
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.

POE
I am calm.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FN-2187
I'm talking to myself.

(BEAT)
Not yet. Okay, go. This way.
FN-2187 walks quickly toward the far wall -- Poe follows --
up the stairs to a two-man SPECIAL FORCES TIE FIGHTER --

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

FN-2187 and Poe (wincing, sore) drop into the back-to-back
cockpit. FN-2187 pulls off his helmet as Poe removes his
cuffs and jacket, fires up the ship with excitement.

POE
I always wanted to fly one of these
things. Can ya shoot?

FN-2187
Blasters, I can!

POE
Okay, same principal! Use the toggle
on the left to switch between
missiles, cannons, and mag pulse --
use the site on the right to aim,
triggers to fire!

FN-2187
This is very complicated
FWOOOOOOM! The TIE FIGHTER LURCHES FORWARD --

POE
I can fix this.

INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY

WIDE: see the ship STRUGGLE TO RISE, CABLES connected to it --
PULL BACK FAST to REVEAL we're inside the main control room.

STAR DESTROYER TECHNICIAN
We have an unsanctioned departure
from bay two.
WHIP TO a FIRST ORDER COLONEL, who responds:

FIRST ORDER COLONEL
Alert General Hux and stop that
fighter.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY

The TIE Fighter LIFTS OFF from the bay, rips CHARGING cables!
Stormtroopers UNPACK and aim MEGABLASTERS.

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

FN-2187 opens fire.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY

FN-2187 TEARS UP PARKED TIE FIGHTERS and GUN EMPLACEMENTS
WITH WELL-AIMED, STRATEGIC LASER BLASTS! Hits the CONTROL

ROOM!

INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY


THE WINDOWS ARE BLOWN IN BY LASER BLASTS!

INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY


POE
I got it!

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

The TIE Fighter blasts from the ship --

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it.

POE
Woooahhh! This thing really moves.
All right, we gotta take out as many
cannons as we can or we're not gonna
get very far!

FN-2187
All right!

POE
I'm gonna get us in position, just
stay sharp!

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN
THE LEVELS OF THE MASSIVE SHIP, then FLIES DOWN AND BACK,
along the ship's belly --

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

Poe flies toward the CANONS --

POE
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?
I've got us dead centered. It's a
clean shot.

FN-2187
Okay, got it.
FN-2187 gets a target, FIRES!

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

LASERS BLAST from the TIE Fighter -- A SERIES OF CANNONS
EXPLODE! Our TIE Fighter SLICES THROUGH the debris!

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

FN-2187 YELLS in celebration:

FN-2187
YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE

THAT?

POE
I saw it! Hey, what's your name?

FN-2187

FN-2187!
Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history.

POE
FN-whaa?

FN-2187
That's the only name they ever gave
me!

POE
Well I ain't using it! FN, huh?
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn!
That all right?
Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.

FINN
"Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that!
I like that!

POE
I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

FINN
Good to meet you, Poe!

POE
Good to meet you too, Finn!

INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY

General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at
a console.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--

GENERAL HUX
Use the ventral cannons.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Yes, sir. Bringing them online --

KYLO REN (O.S.)
General Hux. Is it the Resistance
pilot?
Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.

GENERAL HUX
Yes, and he had help.

(VEXED)
From one of our own.
PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says:

GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
We're checking the registers now to
identify which Stormtrooper it was.

KYLO REN
... The one from the village. FN-

2187.
Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's
Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Sir. Ventral cannons hot.

GENERAL HUX
Fire.

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the
TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts
hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION.
The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU,

THE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8.

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY


POE
One's coming towards you. My right,
your left. Do you see it?

FINN
Hold on! I see it!

POE
Nice shot.
Finn looks up suddenly in alarm --

FINN
Where are you going?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

POE
We're going back to Jakku. That's
where.

FINN
No no no! We can't go back to Jakku!
We need to get outta this system!
NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively.

POE
I got to get to my droid before the
First Order does!

FINN
What - a droid?!

POE
That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange
and white: one of a kind.

FINN
I don't care what color he is! No
droid can be that important!

POE
This one is, pal.

FINN
We need to get as far away from the
First Order as we can! We go back
to Jakku, we die!

POE
That droid's got a map that leads
straight to Luke Skywalker!

FINN
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I--
Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT!

EXT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

The TIE FIGHTER SPARKS AND SMOKES, SPIRALING out of control
toward the surface of Jakku!

INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY

Captain Phasma and General Hux stand before a holographic
projection detailing FN-2187's service records.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
FN-2187 reported to my division, was
evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.

GENERAL HUX
No prior signs of non-conformity?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

CAPTAIN PHASMA
This was his first offense.
A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux.

TECHNICIAN #1
General. They've been hit.

GENERAL HUX
Destroyed?

TECHNICIAN #1

(GETTING READINGS)
Disabled. They were headed back to
Jakku -- the fighter's projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

GENERAL HUX
They were going back for the droid --
send a squad to the wreckage.

EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY

TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:

FINN
Poe! Poe!
Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.

FINN (CONT'D)
Poe!!! POE!
Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

FINN (CONT'D)

POE!!! POE!!!
It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
few moments and IT'S GONE.
Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
And all alone.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
nothingness.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY

General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

GENERAL HUX
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
Capture the droid if we can, but
destroy it if we must.

KYLO REN
How capable are your soldiers,
General?

GENERAL HUX

(WITH VITRIOL)
I won't have you question my methods.

KYLO REN
They're obviously skilled at
committing high treason. Perhaps
Leader Snoke should consider using a
clone army.

GENERAL HUX

(YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH)
My men are exceptionally trained --
programmed from birth--

KYLO REN
Then they should have no problem
retrieving the droid. Unharmed.

GENERAL HUX
Careful, Ren. That your "personal
interests" not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

KYLO REN
I want that map. For your sake, I
suggest you get it.
Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

FINN
Water... water... water..
He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

FINN (CONT'D)
-- Awgh, GAH!
But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

BEEPING BB-8.
Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
OVER METAL URNS for sale --
Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
Finn just watches, stunned.
Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

REY
(To BB-8) Who? Him?
Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
holds the staff on him threateningly:

REY
What's your hurry, thief?

FINN
What--?! Thief?
BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

FINN (CONT'D)
OW! HEY! What?!

REY
The jacket! This droid says you
stole it!

FINN
I've had a pretty messed up day,
alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
stop accusing me -- OW!!!
(BB-8 has ZAPPED him

AGAIN)

STOP IT!

REY
Where'd you get it? It belongs to
his master.
Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
decision: to tell the truth.

FINN
It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
was his name, right?
Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

FINN (CONT'D)
He was captured... by the First Order!
I helped him escape but our ship
crashed.

(RELIVING IT)
Poe didn't make it.
(sees BB-8 is sad,

ROLLS OFF)
Look, I tried to help him. I'm
sorry...
BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

REY
So you're with the Resistance?



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

FINN
Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
the Resistance, yeah.

(WHISPERS)
I'm with the Resistance.
Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

REY
I've never met a Resistance fighter
before.

FINN
Well, this is what we look like.
Some of us. Others look different.

REY
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
he has to get back to your base.

FINN
Apparently he's carrying a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker, and
everyone's after it.
She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

REY
Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
myth.
Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

REY (CONT'D)
What is it?
Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

REY (CONT'D)
(re: her hand)
What are you doing?!

FINN
Come on!
Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through
a maze of tents:







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
Come on, BB-8!

REY
Let go of me!

FINN
No, we gotta move!

REY
(pulls her hand back)
I know how to run without you holding
my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
way!
Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
them! They disappear through a tent.
TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

STORMTROOPER
Call in the air strike!
REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
Quiet, urgent:

REY
They're shooting at both of us!

FINN
Yeah, they saw you with me! You're
marked!

REY
Well, thanks for that!

FINN
I'm not the one who chased you down
with a stick! Does anyone have
blasters around here?!

REY

(TO BB-8)
Are you okay?
Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

REY (CONT'D)
Stop taking my hand!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW

FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT

FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING --

BB-8 ROLLING!




WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

REY
Hey!
As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:

FINN
-- Are you okay?
And that very question touches her -- having never in her
life been asked it.

REY
Yeah.
(extends her hand)
Follow me.
Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off.
LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-

8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn
and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO
TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. They YELL:

FINN
We can't outrun them!
Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:

REY
We might in that quad-jumper!

FINN
We need a pilot!

REY
We've got one!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
You?!
(then, indicates one

OFF-CAMERA)
What about that ship?

REY
That one's garbage!
They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT
IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a
quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:

REY (CONT'D)
The garbage'll do!
She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all
run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first
time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up
the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and
the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit:

REY
Gunner position's down there!

FINN

(CLIMBS DOWN)
Y'ever fly this thing?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat,
frantically flips switches. BB-8 rolls in behind her as the
ENGINES WHINE to life:

REY
No! This ship hasn't been flown in
years!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT
WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to
steady himself.

FINN
Great.
(reacts to seat)
Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey bucks herself up. Doesn't believe her quick words:



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
I can do this, I can do this--
Rey pulls the yoke:

THE FALCON ENGINES LIGHT UP BRIGHT!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

The FALCON RISES, WILDLY -- ITS TARPS FLY OFF -- THE SHIP

SPINS AND TILTS, SLAMS INTO AND CRUMBLES THE TOWN'S ARCHWAY!
From the tents, Unkar Plutt runs out, SCREAMS:

UNKAR

HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!!
The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Rey pilots, headed for the sky!
Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS.

FINN
Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay
low!

REY

WHAT?

FINN
Stay low! It confuses their tracking!
For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to
the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!

REY
BB-8, hold on!
Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke,
stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.

REY

I'M GOING LOW!!!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC,
UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand.
Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING!
Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They
are ROCKED BY A BLAST!



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
What are you doing back there? Are
you ever gonna fire back?!


Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP:

FINN
I'm working on it! Are the shields
up?
Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.

REY
Not so easy without a co-pilot!
Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:

FINN
Try sitting in this thing!
Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and
SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING!

INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY

The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

The Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST!

FINN
We need cover, quick!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey HITS SWITCHES, pilots the best she can:

REY
We're about to get some!

(TO HERSELF)
I hope.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK,
TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING!
The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE
IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Finn continues to fire at the TIE fighters, narrowly missing
them.

FINN
Damn it!
Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

Finn SWOOPS into frame, FIRES --

FINN
Come on... come on...
-- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER!

REY
Nice shot!

FINN
I'm getting pretty good at this!

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

The TIE FIGHTER CRASHES amid the DEBRIS, THREE SCAVENGERS
instantly there to consume the new bounty.
The Falcon, pursued by the ONE REMAINING TIE FIGHTER, slaloms
through the MASSIVE WRECKAGE, GRAZING THE OLD SHIPS as she
goes, pieces flying.
The TIE FIGHTER FIRES -- HITTING THE FALCON'S LOWER TURRET,

SPINNING IT, JAMMING IT INTO FORWARD POSITION!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY


ALARMS BLARE --

FINN
The cannon's stuck in forward
position, I can't move it! You gotta
lose 'em!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she
scans the area -- and gets an idea.

REY
Get ready!

FINN
Okay! For what?

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

Rey pilots the ship up AND INTO THE REAR OF A CRASHED SUPER
STAR DESTROYER! The final TIE FIGHTER FOLLOWS!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Finn peers out the window, realizing where they are:

FINN

ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?!

INT. WRECKED SUPER STAR DESTROYER - DAY

The two ships slalom debris inside the giant ship -- the
Falcon GRAZING ONE SIDE, THEN THE OTHER, SPITTING SPARKS!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space
in the wreck.

REY
Oh no!
Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK,
Rey YANKS THE YOKE --

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer.
Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT!
FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES,

DESTROYING IT!
REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY
as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES!

FINN
Whooo!
The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard
and disappearing into the clouds.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The Falcon ROARS from Jakku off to space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey excitedly unbuckles her seatbelt and hurries back.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR - DAY

Rey races past BB-8, who is RETRACTING his safety restraints.
Finn, adrenalized, climbs from the turret, meets Rey in the
corridor, the LOUNGE in the b.g..









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: REY
FINN Good shooting! Thanks! I--
Now that was some I don't know! -- I've
flying! How did you flown some ships but I've
do that?! No one never left the planet!
trained you? No one? Your last shot was dead
That was amazing! on. You got him with one
(beat) blast!
You set me up for it! (laughs)
(cocky) It was perfect!
That was pretty good.
They're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd
and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced
in joy and camaraderie.
Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels.

REY (CONT'D)
You're ok. He's with the Resistance.
He's going to get you home. We both
will.

(TO FINN)
I don't know your name.

FINN
Finn. What's yours.

REY
I'm Rey.
BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO
HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.

FINN
Rey...
But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge,
STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.

REY
Help me with this! Quick!
They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls
over, watches.

FINN
Whoa! What's going on?
She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku.

INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the
star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Sir. We were unable to acquire the
droid on Jakku.
Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
It escaped capture aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

KYLO REN
The droid... stole a freighter?

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Not exactly, sir. It had help.
Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
We have no confirmation, but we
believe FN-2187 may have been helped
in the escape--
Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE
BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces.
The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka
looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing
scars.

KYLO REN
Anything else?
Mitaka hates to say the following, but:

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
The two were accompanied by a girl.
Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD
REN, into his black glove:

KYLO REN
What girl?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by
STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES.

REY
It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris
wrench -- check in there!
As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below,
overwhelmed by the technical issues --

FINN
How bad is it?!







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
If we wanna live, not good!
BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS:

FINN
They're hunting for us now, we gotta
get outta this system!
Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.

REY
BB-8 said the location of the
Resistance Base is "need to know" --
if I'm taking you there, I need to
know!

FINN
(Throws a tool)
This?
She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8
alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his
moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:

FINN (CONT'D)
You gotta tell us where the base is.

(BB-8 BEEPS)
I don't speak that. Alright, between
us, I'm not with the Resistance,
okay?
(BB-8 backs up)
-- I'm just trying to get away from
the First Order -- but you tell us
where your base is, I'll get there
first -- deal?!
(BB-8 COCKS his head)
Droid, please.
Rey pops up again:

REY
Pilex driver, hurry!
Finn moves for the tool.

REY (CONT'D)
So where's your base?

FINN
(searching, to BB-8)
Go on BB-8, tell her.

(QUIETLY)
Please!
She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole
situation, then BEEPS.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
The Ileenium system?
Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey
disappears below again.

FINN
Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's
the one -- get us there as fast as
you can.
A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends
his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.

REY
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

FINN
(searching for tape)
What about you?

REY
I gotta get back to Jakku!

FINN
(loses his mind)
BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone
always wanna go back to Jakku?! !

REY
No, that one! No. No. The one I'm
pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we
don't patch it up, the propulsion
tank will overflow and flood the
ship with poisonous gas!
Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool.
He throws her the tape, she disappears below:

FINN
This?

REY
Yes!

FINN
Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you
can fly anywhere! Why go back?!
You got a family? You got a
boyfriend? Cute boyfriend?
The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:

REY
None of your business, THAT'S WHY!
But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
... That can't be good.

REY

(HEADS OFF)
-- No it can't be --

FINN FOLLOWS REY TO:

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

They plop into the seats, in a panic. She checks the dead

INSTRUMENTATION PANEL:

REY
Someone's locked onto us -- all
controls are overridden.
Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out.

REY (CONT'D)
Get off. Get off! See anything?

FINN
... Oh no.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The Millennium Falcon, powerless, is a sitting duck.
SOMETHING EPIC appears from ABOVE: THE ANTENNA ARRAY IS THE

FIRST WE SEE OF A MASSIVE FREIGHTER, ITS GIANT HANGAR OPEN

LIKE A HUGE MOUTH WHICH SWALLOWS THE FALCON LIKE A WHALE!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Finn PLOPS into his seat, horrified.

FINN
It's the First Order.

REY
What do we do-- there must be

SOMETHING --
Finn's mind races -- then:

FINN
You said poisonous gas --

REY
-- Yeah, but I fixed that --

FINN
Can you unfix it?
Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

The GAS MASKS hanging in the lounge are GRABBED.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Finn and Rey, gas masks on, quickly climb into the open
grating area.

REY
C'mon BB-8.
They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he
weighs a TON.

FINN
I got it.

REY
Oooh...

FINN
I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...

UNDER THE GRATING
Finn pulls the grating over them as Rey works on the controls.

REY
You think this'll work on the
Stormtroopers?

FINN
Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke,
not toxins.
LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS
THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:

FINN (CONT'D)
Hurry!

REY
I'm hurrying!
Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA
BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM,
ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only.

HAN
Chewie, we're home.
Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads
off one way, Han in another.
The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look
up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening.
They're SCARED.

HAN (CONT'D)
Where are the others? Where's the
pilot?

REY
...I'm the pilot...



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
You?
Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him --

REY
No, it's true: we're the only ones
on board.

FINN
You can understand that thing?

HAN
And "that thing" can understand you
too, so watch it. Come on outta
there.
They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull
himself out.

HAN (CONT'D)
Where'd you get this ship?

REY
Niima Outpost.

HAN
Jakku?! That junkyard?

FINN
Thank you! Junkyard!

HAN

(TO CHEWIE)
Told ya we should've double-checked
the Western Reaches!

(TO REY)
Who had it, Ducain?

REY
I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He
stole it from the Irving Boys, who
stole it from Ducain.

HAN
Who stole it from me! Well, you
tell him Han Solo just stole back
the Millennium Falcon for good.
Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't
see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles.
Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.

REY
This is the Millennium Falcon? You're
Han Solo?







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
I used to be.

FINN
Han Solo? The Rebellion General?

REY
No, the smuggler!

FINN

(TO CHEWIE)
Wasn't he a war hero?!
Chewie replies: "Yeah, I guess, kinda..." Rey calls out:

REY
This is the ship that made the Kessel
Run in fourteen parsecs...!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SAME

Han enters the cockpit.

HAN
Twelve! Fourteen.
A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS

HIM:

HAN (CONT'D)
Hey! Some moof-milker put a
compressor on the ignition line!
Han moves to the corridor.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY


REY
Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a
mistake too, puts too much stress on

THE HYPERDRIVE--

HAN

(OVERLAPPING HER)
-- Stress on the hyperdrive--
(who is she? Then:)
Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll
drop them at the nearest inhabited
planet.

REY
Wait! No -- we need your help!

HAN
My help?

REY
This droid has to get to the
Resistance base as soon as possible!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.
Yup: Han stops in his tracks.

FINN (CONT'D)
You are the Han Solo that fought
with the Rebellion. You knew him.
The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn.

HAN
Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.
Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!

HAN (CONT'D)
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten

LOOSE--
Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then
BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN:

FINN
Wait -- a what?! Did you just say
Rathtars? Hey!

INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY

The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han
moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him.

FINN
You're not hauling Rathtars on this
freighter, are you?

HAN
I'm hauling Rathtars.
On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE
SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is
LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.

HAN (CONT'D)
Oh great. It's the Guavian Death
Gang -- they must've tracked us from
Nantoon.
Han heads off as:

REY
What's a Rathtar?

INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY

Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo
containers.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: HAN
They're big and dangerous...

FINN
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!

REY
No.

FINN
Good.
They turn a corner:

HAN
I got three of 'em going to King
Prana.

FINN
THREE?! How'd you get them on board?

HAN
I used to have a bigger crew.
Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.

CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND

CO. ARE THERE.

HAN
Get below deck and stay there until
I say so -- don't even think about
taking the Falcon.

REY
What about BB-8?

HAN
He stays with me -- until I get rid
of the gang, then you can have him
back and be on your way.

FINN
What about the Rathtars... where are
you keeping them?
A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS
into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart
stops.

HAN
There's one.

REY
What are you gonna do?

HAN
Same thing I always do: talk my way
out of it.

(CHEWIE MOAN-TALKS)
Yes, I do. Every time.

INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY

A PORTAL opens. The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. One man in
a SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass
UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop
at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet
away in the middle of the long hall.

BALA-TIK
Han Solo. You are a dead man.
Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back
and forth at the gang, and Han.

HAN
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

BALA-TIK
The problem is we loaned you fifty
thousand for this job.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

They look up, trying to get a view.

REY
Can you see them?

FINN
No.
They start crawling down the crawl space.

BALA-TIK
I heard you also borrowed fifty
thousand from Kanjiklub.

HAN
You know you can't trust those little
freaks! How long've we known each
other?
Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:

REY
They have blasters...

FINN
A lot of 'em.
We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company
in the distance.

BALA-TIK
The question is how much longer will
we know each other? Not long. We
want our money back now.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap?
I spent that money.

BALA-TIK
Kanjiklub wants their investment
back, too.

HAN
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

BALA-TIK
Tell that to Kanjiklub.
The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he
turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB
MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.
Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its
LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:

HAN
Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:

TASU LEECH
Wrong again, Solo. It's over for
you.
Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous.
Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start
CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.

HAN
Boys. You're both gonna get
what I promised! Have I ever
not delivered for you before?

BALA-TIK
Yeah.

TASU LEECH
Twice!
Han realizes he's right.

HAN
What was the second time?

BALA-TIK
Your game is old. There's no one in
the galaxy left for you to swindle.

TASU LEECH
Nowhere left for you to hide.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

BALA-TIK
That BB unit... the First Order is
looking for one just like it. And
two fugitives.
Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense.
BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes:
Finn and Rey are in real trouble.

HAN
First I've heard of it.
Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid.
Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):

RAZOO QIN-FEE
Search the freighter.
One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,
AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for:
FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING
FAST in the opposite direction they came.
Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at
a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.

REY
Wait wait wait wait. If we close
the blast doors in that corridor, we
can trap both gangs!

FINN
Close the blast doors from here?

REY
Resetting the fuses should do it.
Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as
they do. Finn quickly joins in.
Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a
GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --

SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!
BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.
The GANGS look around.
Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY:

HAN
... I got a bad feeling about this...
Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below,
where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.

REY
Oh no.

FINN
Oh no, what?

REY

(PALE)
Wrong fuses.

IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS:

BALA-TIK
Kill them! And take the droid!
The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND

THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS
SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY!
Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as
a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The
Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT.

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE
KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him
with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep
steppin....

INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks.

FINN
This was a mistake!

REY
Huge!

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing
Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the
corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to
help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a
distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way.
Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --
they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE
TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we
land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out,
quickly.


They turn a corridor --

REY
What do they look like?



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE
RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH.

FINN
They look like that.
Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a

RATHTAR IS THERE!

FINN (CONT'D)
This way!

REY
Are you sure?
They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY

FAST!

REY (CONT'D)

FINN!
But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey --

FINN

REY!

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY

TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING
as he struggles to get loose!
Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen.

REY

FINN!!!!
Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she
realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light
up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --
and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN
BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then

SLAMS THE BUTTON!

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY

The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S
TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL
WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately
shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg!
Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is
adrenaline-rushed, in shock:

REY
Finn!

FINN
It had me! But the door--!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
That was lucky!
ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY

Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE
with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL.

HAN
I got the door. Cover us!
Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han
CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie
exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls.
THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE
IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a

LOUD GROAN!

HAN (CONT'D)
Chewie! You okay?
Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,

BADASS!

HAN (CONT'D)
(looks at bowcaster)
Wow. Come on! Come on!

INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY

Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward
the Falcon. Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them.

REY
Han!
Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han
says to Rey:

HAN
You, close the door behind us!

(TO FINN)
You take care of Chewie!
Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie,
who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters
fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat.

HAN
Hey, where are you going?









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump
too -- if we don't prime that we're
not going anywhere.

HAN
I hate that guy.
Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:

REY
And you could use a co-pilot.

HAN
I got one, he's back there.

IN THE LOUNGE, CHEWIE IS IN PAIN --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Han and Rey in the seats:

HAN
Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of
here at lightspeed --

REY

(SHOCKED)
From inside the hangar? Is that
even possible?

HAN
I never ask that question until after
I've done it.
A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its
GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:

HAN (CONT'D)
This is not how I thought this day
was gonna go -- angle the shields --
Hang on back there!
IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a
first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --

FINN

(HUGE PROBLEM)
No problem!

INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY

Three GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON --
hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD!
The ship is hit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY


HAN
Come on baby, don't let me down!
He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.

HAN (CONT'D)
What?!
But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.

REY
Compressor.
Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch
again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH
LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED
BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY
as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:

EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving
the cargo ship behind.

INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window,
SEETHING. Makes a CALL:

BALA-TIK
Inform the First Order that Han Solo
has the droid they want. And it's
aboard the Millennium Falcon.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET,
frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet
that has been hacked and modified into something sinister.
Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice
very much in control, of power:

SNOKE (V.O.)
The droid will soon be delivered to
the Resistance...

INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at
someone addressing them.
We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS
in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
and powerful, all at the same time.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SNOKE
... Leading them to the last Jedi.
If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi
will rise.

GENERAL HUX
Supreme Leader, I take full
responsibility for th--

SNOKE
General! Our strategy must now
change.

GENERAL HUX
The weapon. It is ready. I believe
the time has come to use it. We
shall destroy the government that
supports the Resistance, the Republic.
Without their friends to protect
them, the Resistance will be
vulnerable, and we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.
Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

SNOKE
Go. Oversee preparations.

GENERAL HUX
Yes, Supreme Leader.
General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him
go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.

SNOKE
There's been an awakening. Have you
felt it?

KYLO REN
Yes.

SNOKE
There's something more. The droid
we seek is aboard the Millennium
Falcon. In the hands of your father,
Han Solo.
Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.

KYLO REN
He means nothing to me.

SNOKE
Even you, master of the Knights of
Ren, have never faced such a test.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN

(STEELY RESOLVE)
By the grace of your training, I
will not be seduced.

SNOKE
We shall see. We shall see.
A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed,
filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque
evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been
a HOLOGRAM all along.

EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY

RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot,
ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where
CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER.

SPARKS!

HAN
Electrical overload!

REY
I can fix that!

HAN
The coolant's leaking!

REY
Try transferring auxiliary power to
the secondary tank--

HAN
-- Secondary tank, I got it!

INT. LOUNGE:

CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage
on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off.

FINN
Chewie, come on! I need help with
this giant hairy thing! Stop moving!
Chewie!

INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


HAN
You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal
with me!

INT. LOUNGE:

As Finn struggles to bandage the Wookiee:

FINN
Hurt him?! He almost killed me six
times!
(Chewie GRABS HIM by
the collar, ROARS)
Which is fine.

INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


HAN
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna
be pieces of us in three different
systems.
Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied,
sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.

HAN (CONT'D)
What'd you do?

REY
I by-passed the compressor.
He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits,
walking past BB-8.

HAN
Move, Ball.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han
checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.

HAN
Nah, don't say that, you did great.
Just rest.
Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside
him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:

HAN (CONT'D)
Good job, kid. And thanks.

FINN
You're welcome.
Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the
PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces
start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to
turn it off.

HAN
So, fugitives, huh?

REY
The First Order wants the map.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY (CONT'D)
(re: Finn and BB-8)
Finn is with the Resistance...

(SHRUGS)
... I'm just a scavenger.
Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages
to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.

HAN
Let's see whatcha got.

REY

(TO BB-8)
Go ahead.
BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC

MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS.
They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through
stars, becomes reflective.

HAN
This map's not complete. It's just
a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared,
people have been looking for him.

REY
Why'd he leave?

HAN
He was training a new generation of
Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned
against him, destroyed it all. Luke
felt responsible... He walked away
from everything.

FINN
Do you know what happened to him?

HAN
There're a lot of rumors. Stories.
The people who knew him the best
think he went looking for the first
Jedi temple.

REY
The Jedi were real?

HAN
I used to wonder that myself. Thought
it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --
magical power holding together good,
evil, the dark side and the light.

(BEAT)
'Crazy thing is, it's true. The
Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's
all true.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle
some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises
and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back

DOWN:

HAN (CONT'D)
No, you rest.
(To Rey and Finn)
You want my help? You're getting
it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll
get your droid home. This is our
stop.
Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following.

EXT. LIGHTSPEED TO SPACE - DAY

BEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a
BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Han pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot.
Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears.

REY

(QUIETLY)
... I didn't know there was this
much green in the whole galaxy...
Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him.

EXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY

The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a
CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE.
The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN,
smallish freighters.

EXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side.
She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side,
LAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

From BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages,
retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned.

FINN
Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're
walking into here --

HAN
D'you just call me "Solo"?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should
know, I'm a big deal in the
Resistance. Which puts a real target
on my back. Are there any
conspirators here? First Order
sympathizers?

HAN
Listen big deal, you've got another
problem. Women always figure out
the truth.
Hands him a BLASTER.

HAN (CONT'D)
Always.
Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the
castle.

HAN
You might need this.

REY
I think I can handle myself.

HAN
I know you do. That's why I'm giving
it to you. Take it.
Rey picks it up. Grips it.

HAN (CONT'D)
You know how to use one of these?

REY
Yeah, you pull the trigger.

HAN
There's a little bit more to it than
that. You got a lot to learn. You
got a name?

REY
Rey.

HAN
Rey. I've been thinkin' about
bringing on some more crew, Rey. A
second mate. Someone to help out.
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me, appreciates the Falcon.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
Are you offering me a job?

HAN
I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't
pay much.

REY
You're offering me a job.

HAN
I'm thinking about it.
Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she
can't cross.

HAN (CONT'D)
Well?

REY
If you were, I'd be flattered. But
I have to get home.
Han looks at her, questioningly.

HAN
Jakku?
Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.

REY

(BEAT)
I've already been away too long.

HAN

(TO CHEWIE)
Chewie, check out the ship as best
you can.

HAN (CONT'D)
It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes
you.
Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Han walks them to the castle.

FINN
Solo, why are we here again?

HAN
To get your droid on a clean ship.

REY
Clean?







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Do you think it was luck that Chewie
and I found the Falcon? If we can
find it on our scanners, the First
Order's not far behind. Want to get
BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata
is our best bet.

FINN
We can trust her, right?

HAN
Relax, kid. She's run this watering
hole for a thousand years. Maz is a
bit of an acquired taste, so let me
do the talking. And whatever you
do, don't stare...

REY AND FINN
At what?

HAN
Any of it.
The door opens. Music. Madness. And...

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a
room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble,
drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the
BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who
suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS
TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES.
This is MAZ KANATA.

MAZ
Han Solo!
Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here.

HAN
(Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving)
Hey, Maz!
NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.

MAZ
Where's my boyfriend?

HAN
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

MAZ
I like that Wookiee. I assume you
need something. Desperately. Let's
get to it.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey
are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do --
passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE
NETAL, who watches them suspiciously.
A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8
following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a
small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.

GA-97
Alert the Resistance. Their missing
droid is here!
And we CUT TO:

IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER
Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a
communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled:

BAZINE
Inform the First Order... I've found
the droid.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY

A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone
OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see.

KYLO REN
Forgive me. I feel it again. The
pull to the light. Supreme Leader
senses it. Show me again, the power
of the darkness, and I will let
nothing stand in our way. Show me,
Grandfather, and I will finish what
you started.
As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW
HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,

ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER.

CUT TO:

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY

Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says:

MAZ
A map to Skywalker himself? You're
right back in the mess.

HAN
Maz, I need you to get this droid to
Leia.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MAZ
Hmm. No. You've been running away
from this fight for too long. Han,
nyakee nago wadda. Go home!

HAN
Leia doesn't want to see me.

FINN
Please, we came here for your help.

REY
What fight?

MAZ
The only fight: against the dark
side. Through the ages, I've seen
evil take many forms. The Sith.
The Empire. Today, it is the First
Order. Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy. We must face
them. Fight them. All of us.

FINN
There is no fight against the First
Order! Not one we can win. Look
around. There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already. I bet you
the First Order is on their way right--
Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing
him -- her eyes get HUGE.

FINN (CONT'D)
What's this? What are you doing?
Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly
BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the
tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards
Finn.

FINN (CONT'D)
Solo, what is she doing?

HAN
I don't know, but it ain't good.

MAZ
If you live long enough you see the
same eyes in different people. I'm
looking at the eyes of a man who
wants to run.

FINN
(eyes on Maz)
You don't know a thing about me.
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

(MORE)





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN (CONT'D)
You don't know the First Order like
I do. They'll slaughter us. We all
need to run.
Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her
chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.

MAZ
You see those two? They'll trade
work for transportation to the Outer
Rim. There, you can disappear.
Finn sees them. Considers.

REY
Finn!

FINN
Come with me.

REY
What about BB-8? We're not done
yet. We have to get him back to
your base.

FINN
I can't.
Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.

HAN
Keep it, kid.
Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses
back to normal, and turns to Han.

MAZ
Who's the girl?

ON FINN
Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.

FINN
I was told you could get me to the
Outer Rim.
Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.

REY
What are you doing?
Finn gets up to talk to her.

FINN
(to Big Head)
Don't leave without me.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Embarrassed, Finn moves her away.

REY
You can't just go. I won't let you.

FINN
I'm not who you think I am.

REY
Finn, what are you talking about?

FINN
I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero.
I'm a Stormtrooper.

(STOPS HER)
Like all of them, I was taken from a
family I'll never know. And raised
to do one thing...

(EMOTIONAL)
But my first battle, I made a choice.
I wasn't going to kill for them. So
I ran.

FINN (CONT'D)
Right into you. And you looked at
me like no one ever had. I was
ashamed of what I was. But I'm done
with the First Order. I'm never
going back. Rey, come with me.

REY
Don't go.

FINN
Take care of yourself. Please.
Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
watches Finn return to the aliens...
And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
through it.
Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
back at her one last time.

INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

DOOR OPENS.
Hesitant, Rey enters.

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY

Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
heavy with tension.
Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

YOUNG GIRL

NO!
She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
NIGHT. We PAN to:
R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
and see...
A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

YOUNG GIRL
No, come back!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

UNKAR PLUTT
Quiet, girl!
The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
her to see she is..
In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
She HEARS something and turns to look.
Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
just happened.

REY
What was that? I shouldn't have
gone in there.

MAZ
That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
father's before him and now, it calls
to you!
Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.

REY
I have to get back to Jakku.

MAZ
Han told me.
(reaches out, hold

REY'S HAND)
Dear child. I see your eyes. You
already know the truth. Whomever
you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
never coming back. But... there's
someone who still could.

REY
Luke.

MAZ
The belonging you seek is not behind
you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,
but I know the Force. It moves
through and surrounds every living
thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.

CONTINUED:

MAZ (CONT'D)
The light. It's always been there.
It will guide you. The saber. Take
it.
Rey suddenly stands.

REY
I'm never touching that again. I
don't want any part of this.
And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
Heads toward the woods.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
come.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY

A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

GENERAL HUX
Today is the end of the Republic!
The end of a regime that acquiesces
to disorder! At this very moment,
in a system far from here the New
Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
secretly supporting the treachery of
the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
machine which you have built, upon
which we stand, will bring an end to
the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
All remaining systems will bow to
the First Order! And will remember
this... as the last day of the
Republic!



INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of
nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY


GENERAL HUX

FIRE!
And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a
ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC

BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO
THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!
The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
eyes, CUT TO:

INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY

Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
runs cold, his heart sinks.

EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL

SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST

FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!

EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT

The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN

APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING

ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN (O.S.)
It was the Republic.
Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through
the crowd. With dread:

FINN (CONT'D)
The First Order, they've done it.
Where's Rey?

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

REY
What are you doing?

(HE BEEPS)
You have to go back.
(he BEEPS again)

REY (CONT'D)
BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to
go back, you're too important.
They'll help you.
Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:

MAZ
I've had this for ages...

MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:

MAZ
Kept it locked away.

HAN
Where'd you get that?

MAZ
A good question for another time.

(TO FINN)
Take it! Find your friend!
Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.

MAZ (CONT'D)
Those beasts! They're here!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

STORMTROOPER
FN-417, hold position!
Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE!
She panics, then realizes:

REY
Safety!
SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
and retreats, calls to BB-8:
BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
chasing Troopers!

EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY

Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches:

STORMTROOPER #4
Sir, the droid was spotted heading
west, with a girl.
Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:

REY
You have to keep going, stay out of
sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.
(BB-8 BEEPS; bravely
through her fear)
I hope so, too.
BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --

EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through
debris.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Come on, Chewie!
Maz turns to Finn:

MAZ
Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now
go.

FINN
I need a weapon.
Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.

MAZ
You have one!
He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON.
HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at
Stormtroopers, taking some out!

HAN
Hey, can I try that?
Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
and sends them flying.

HAN (CONT'D)

(TO CHEWBACCA)
I like this thing.
FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then
another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
Stormtrooper has a MACE --

STORMTROOPER
Traitor!
FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper
KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him,
when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS!
Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!
Han helps him up.

HAN
You okay, Big deal?



FINN
Thanks!
But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.

STORMTROOPER
Don't move! TK-338, we have targets
in custody!



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER
as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up.
Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them.
Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward
a transport, hands on their heads.
But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han
turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-

WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE

FIRST ORDER SHIPS!

PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS.

STORMTROOPER (CONT'D)
We have incoming at two-eight-point-
six! Move! Dispatch! Move!
Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble
all squads! Anti-air cover en route
to our position!

HAN
It's the Resistance.
One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN
and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers!

INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY

It's Poe Dameron at the stick of his X-wing.

POE
Go straight ahead and don't let these
dogs scare you!

JESS (V.O.)
Copy that!

SNAP (V.O.)
We're with you, Poe!
The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED
in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT

UP.

HAN
Quick!
Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots
a Trooper.

FINN
Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva
pilot!

INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY


POE

WOOHOO!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster
aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer.
And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

DEFLECT EVERY BLAST.
She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand
rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE.

KYLO REN
The girl I've heard so much about.
He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
The droid.
He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS

HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
Where is it?

WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST

ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE.

STORMTROOPER
Request air support!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES
TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After
a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand.
She is relieved but still afraid.

KYLO REN
The map. You've seen it.
Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony --
Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE
EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.

STORMTROOPER #5
Sir, Resistance fighters! We need
more troops.
Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN
Pull the division out. Forget the
droid. We have what we need.
A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS

FROM FRAME!

EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING
another TIE Fighter! On the ground:

STORMTROOPER
Pull back the tree line!
Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS.
FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of
breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY
IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS --
Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle.
Han is ROCKED.

FINN

NO!! REY!!!
Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS
AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally

CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:

FINN (CONT'D)
No, no, no, no... REY!!
In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the
receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order
ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads

BACK FOR THE CASTLE.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

Post battle. Finn runs to Han:

FINN
He took her! Did you see that? He
took her. She's gone!

HAN

(WALKS PAST)
Yeah, yeah, I know...
And he and Chewie head off.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris.
BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport.
ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
Finally, the transport door opens.
And standing there is LEIA.
She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
embers, no one says a word.
Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

C-3PO
Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-
Threepio!
(sees Han, stops)
You probably don't recognize me
because of the red arm.
(sees Leia,

INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)
Look who it is! Did you see who?
Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General.
Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.

(BB-8 BEEPS)
Yes, I must get my proper arm
reinstalled.
He hurries off. Finally, alone again.

HAN
You changed your hair.

LEIA
Same jacket.

HAN
No, new jacket.
Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

HAN (CONT'D)
... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son.
He was here.
Leia hears this.
Maz watches through the smoke.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The FALCON and surviving X-WINGS ROAR past camera toward a

PLANET WITH GREEN FLORA AND A RING OF ASTEROIDS.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
This is D'QAR.

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

The SHIPS DESCENDING among grassy mounds and sunken
structures.

EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant
trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING
to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS,
a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium
Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate,
searching.
Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.

IT IS POE!
Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the
droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't
believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a
distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.

FINN
Poe. Poe Dameron.
They move to each other -- and embrace.

FINN (CONT'D)
You're alive!

POE
So are you!

FINN
What happened to you?

POE
What happened? I got thrown from
the crash, woke up at night -- no
you, no ship, nothing--
BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.

POE (CONT'D)
BB-8 says that you saved him.

FINN
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

POE
You completed my mission, Finn.
That's my jacket?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
Oh here.

POE
No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you.
You're a good man, Finn.

FINN
Poe -- I need your help.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift
command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They
arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance
Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA:

POE
General Organa. Sorry to interrupt,
this is Finn, he needs to talk to

YOU --

LEIA
(takes Finn's hand)
And I need to talk to him. That was
incredibly brave, what you did.
Renouncing the First Order, saving
this man's life --

FINN
(surprised she knows)
Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of
mine was taken prisoner--

LEIA
Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:

POE
Finn's familiar with the weapon that
destroyed the Hosnian system. He
worked on the base.

LEIA
We're desperate for anything you can
tell us.

FINN
That's where my friend was taken --
I've got to get there, fast.

LEIA
And I will do everything I can to
help, but first you must tell us all
you know.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. DR. KALONIA uses a
device to help heal his shoulder. Chewie TALKS.

DR. KALONIA

(CHEWIE TALKS)
That sounds very scary.

(CHEWIE TALKS)
You must be so brave.
Chewie agrees.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a
BASE COMPUTER. THE PROJECTED MAP APPEARS in HOLOGRAM. Leia
enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING
HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.

C-3PO
General, I regret to inform you, but
this map recovered from BB-8 is only
partially complete. And even worse,
it matches no charted system on
record. We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.

LEIA
I can't believe I was so foolish to
think that I could just find Luke
and bring him home.

HAN
Leia...

LEIA
Don't do that.

HAN
Do what?
She heads off.

LEIA
Anything.
Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.

C-3PO
Princesses.
Han follows Leia across the base floor:

HAN
I'm trying to be helpful!









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LEIA
When did that ever help? And don't
say the Death Star.

HAN

(SIGHS)

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off
the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T
RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
R2. Nothing. Then:

C-3PO (O.S.)
BB-8. You're wasting your time.
BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.

C-3PO (CONT'D)
It is very doubtful that R2 would
have the rest of the map in his backup
data.

(BB-8 BEEPS)
I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in
low power mode ever since Master
Luke went away. Sadly, he may never
be his old self again.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns.

HAN
Listen to me, will you? I know every
time you... every time you look at
me, you're reminded of him.

LEIA
You think I want to forget him? I
want him back!
Han looks at her with sympathy.

HAN
There was nothing we could've done.
(hard for him to say)
There was too much Vader in him.

LEIA
That's why I wanted him to train
with Luke. I just never should have
sent him away. That's when I lost
him. That's when I lost you both.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
We both had to deal with it in our
own way. I went back to the only
thing I was ever good at.

LEIA
We both did.

HAN
We lost our son, forever.

LEIA
No.

(LONG BEAT)
It was Snoke.
Han takes this in.

LEIA (CONT'D)
He seduced our son to the dark side.
But we can still save him. Me.
You.

HAN
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could

I?

LEIA
Luke is a Jedi... you're his father.
There's still light in him. I know
it.

GENERAL STATURA
General, the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright
restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask
in place, standing there.

REY
Where am I?

KYLO REN

(LONG BEAT)
You're my guest.

REY
Where are the others?

KYLO REN
You mean the murderers, traitors and
thieves you call friends?
(Rey stares at him)
You'll be relieved to hear that I
have no idea.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
You still want to kill me.

REY
That happens when you're being hunted
by a creature in a mask.
Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
before she regains her own mask of defiance.

KYLO REN
Tell me about the droid.

REY
(a nervous beat)
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

KYLO REN
He's carrying a section of a
navigational chart. We have the
rest, recovered from archives of the
Empire. We need the last piece.
And somehow, you convinced the droid
to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
You know I can take whatever I want.
Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
... You're so lonely... so afraid to
leave...
(then, slight smile)
At night, desperate to sleep... you
imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
the island...
Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
break free, but can't budge.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
And Han Solo. You feel like he's
the father you never had. He would've
disappointed you.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:

REY
-- Get out of my head --
But this just makes Kylo lean closer.

KYLO REN
I know you've seen the map. It's in
there... and now you'll give it to
me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
too.
Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:

REY
I'm not giving you anything.

KYLO REN
We'll see.
He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --

DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED

AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!

REY
... You... you're afraid... that you
will never be as strong as... Darth
Vader!
KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were
FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body
is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on
Kylo Ren, who starts to leave.
And we PRELAP:

SNOKE (V.O.)
This scavenger, resisted you?

INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke.

KYLO REN
She's strong with the Force, untrained
but, stronger than she knows.
And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:

SNOKE
And the droid?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:

GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
Ren believed it was no longer valuable
to us.
Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the
platform beside Ren.

GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
That the girl was all we needed. As
a result, the droid has most likely
been returned to the hands of the
enemy. They may have the map already.
Snoke is visibly furious.

SNOKE
Then the Resistance must be destroyed
before they get to Skywalker.

GENERAL HUX
We have their location. We tracked
their reconnaissance ship to the
Ileenium system.

SNOKE
Good. Then we will crush them once
and for all. Prepare the weapon.
Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant
at all --

KYLO REN
Supreme Leader. I can get the map
from the girl. I just need your
guidance.

SNOKE
If what you say about this girl is
true, bring her to me.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's
happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
intense beat. Then says:

REY
You will remove these restraints.
And leave this cell, with the door
open.
The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

TROOPER GUARD #2
What did you say?
Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her
confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:

REY
You will remove these restraints.
And leave this cell, with the door
open.
The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:

TROOPER GUARD #2
I'll tighten those restraints,
scavenger scum!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And
tries again.

REY
You will remove these restraints.
And leave this cell, with the door
open.

TROOPER GUARD #2
I will remove these restraints. And
leave this cell, with the door open.
He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS
AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS
IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:

REY
And you will drop your weapon.

TROOPER GUARD #2
And I'll drop my weapon.
The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --
Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has

LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN.
REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in
the empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS

HAPPENED.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN

NO!
Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and --

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR
the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces
of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor.
Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP
TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Workers at their controls. Vast snowy landscape seen outside.
Their GAUGES RISE -- THE WEAPON CHARGING SLOWLY --

GENERAL HUX
Begin charging the weapon!

STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
Yes, sir. Weapon charging.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE PLANET - DAY

A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY
surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER.
MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT
REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL
LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN
to the Starkiller Base planet.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is
huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays
a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF
STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO,
Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB,
and others. An urgent, messy strategy session --

POE
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's
report.

SNAP
They've somehow created a hyper
lightspeed weapon built within the
planet itself.

BRANCE
A laser cannon?









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SNAP
We're not sure how to describe a
weapon of this scale.

MAJOR EMATT

(HORRIBLE MEMORIES)
It's another Death Star.

POE
I wish that were the case, Major.
Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS.

POE (CONT'D)
This was the Death Star.
Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND
SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER

BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE
PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in
comparison.

POE (CONT'D)
This is Starkiller Base.
This is news to many here, and they're stunned.

HAN
So it's big.

ADMIRAL ACKBAR
How is it possible to power a weapon
of this size?

FINN
It uses the power of the sun. As
the weapon is charged, the sun is
drained until it disappears.
An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.

LEIA
(eyes on datacard)
The First Order: they're charging
the weapon again, now.
(then, heart sinking)
Our system is the next target.

C-3PO
Oh my. Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.
They all react to this horrible news.

HAN
Okay, how do we blow it up?
(all eyes on him)
There's always a way to do that.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
But no one has anything. Leia watches the silence,
frustrated. Finally, rallying them:

LEIA
Han's right.
Han is surprised.

ADMIRAL STATURA
(at first hesitant)
In order for that amount of power to
be contained, that base would need
some kind of thermal oscillator...

FINN
There is one.
All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location
on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK

HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE.

FINN (CONT'D)
Precinct 47. Here.

ADMIRAL STATURA

(HYPOTHESIZING)
If we can destroy that oscillator,
it might de-stabilize the core and
cripple the weapon.

MAJOR EMATT
... Maybe the planet.
Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG
HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.

POE
We'll go in there and we'll hit that
oscillator with everything we got.

ADMIRAL ACKBAR
They have defensive shields that our
ships cannot penetrate.

HAN
We disable the shields.

(TO FINN)
Kid, you worked there, what do you
got?

FINN
(beat, then:)
I can do it.

HAN
I like this guy.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
I can disable the shields. But I
have to be there, on the planet--

HAN
We'll get you there.

LEIA
Han, how?

HAN
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

POE
So we disable the shields, take out
the oscillator and we blow up their
big gun. All right. Let's go!
And everyone splits.

EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY


SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS
MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb,
and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. Mechanics make
adjustments as Crews fuel the jets. Ground controllers move
ships into takeoff formation. Pilots prep their ships,
including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing.
Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket.
Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. Finn watches
Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. Over this:

EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon
for one more daring run, maybe its last:

HAN
Chewie, check that donal capitator.
Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be
careful with those - they're
explosives.

FINN
Now you tell me?

LEIA
No matter how much we fought, I've
always hated watching you leave.
Han looks over, there's Leia.

HAN
That's what I did it. So you'd miss
me.
She laughs, moves up close to him.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LEIA
I did miss you.
He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue:

HAN
It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh?
Some of it was...good.

LEIA
... Pretty good.

HAN
Some things never change.

LEIA

(SMILES)
True. You still drive me crazy.
Han places his hands on her shoulders. It could be thirty
years ago.
They both know there's a good chance he won't make it back.
They pull each other tight, holding for dear life. Quietly,

LONGINGLY:

LEIA (CONT'D)
If you see our son again, bring him
home.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY


STORMTROOPER
Sir, sensors triggered in hangar
718. We're searching the area.

KYLO REN
She's just beginning to test her

her, the more dangerous she becomes.
Kylo exits.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.

EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY

The Falcon SCREAMS PAST --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Flying at LIGHTSPEED, Finn, with Han and Chewie.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
How are we getting in?

HAN
Their shields have a fractional
refresh rate. Keeps anything
traveling slower than lightspeed
from getting through.
Finn is suddenly filled with dread.

FINN
We're gonna make our landing approach
at lightspeed?!
Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!

HAN
Alright, Chewie, get ready.
Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS.

HAN (CONT'D)
And Now!
Chewie and Han hit switches --



EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE/STARKILLER BASE - DAY

The Falcon's ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS INSTANTLY FROM LIGHTSPEED TO
PLANET ATMOSPHERE -- it's suddenly FLYING 100 FEET ABOVE THE

SNOWY, ROCKY GROUND, HEADED FOR A THICK FOREST!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY


CHEWIE GROANS:

HAN

I AM PULLING UP!!!

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

But the Falcon has no time -- it PLOWS through the trees!
It then RISES --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

ALARMS BLARE as the ship SLAMS THROUGH BRANCHES, SHOOTS TOWARD
SKY! Han does his best to steer -- Chewie GROANS -- in the
madness Han YELLS:

HAN
I get any higher, they'll see us!
And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY

A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the
MILLENNIUM FALCON HURTLES OUT OF THE FOREST! From an eruption
of BRANCHES and PINE, the ship DIVES -- SLAMS INTO THE SNOW!
It DIGS THROUGH A THOUSAND YARDS OF WHITE until it finally
comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY


OFFICER
Sir, she was not found in hangar 718
but all troops are on alert.

KYLO REN
Put every hangar on lock-down. She's
going to try to steal a ship to--
Suddenly, Kylo senses something. Something familiar.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
Han Solo...

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie
cross the terrain. WALKERS appears on the horizon. Han,
Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. Chewie
carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES.

FINN
The flooding tunnels are over that
ridge. We'll get in that way.

HAN
What was your job when you were based
here?

FINN
Sanitation.

HAN
Sanitation? Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

FINN
I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.

HAN
People are counting on us! The galaxy
is counting on us--!

FINN
Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll
use the Force!

HAN
That's not how the Force works--!



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Chewie MOANTALKS.

HAN (CONT'D)
Oh really, you're cold?

FINN
Come on!
They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE

LASER SIPHON SHOOTING INTO THE SKY, SLOWLY SUCKING THE SUN

DRY.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 4 - DAY

A STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. The
door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there!

STORMTROOPER FN-9330
Hey!
He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE
ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead.
Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a
corner, wary.

HAN
The longer we're here, less luck
we're going to have. The shields?

FINN
I have an idea about that.
Han and Chewie follow Finn.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Captain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers.
Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF

FRAME BY CHEWIE!
And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS

ARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER
ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn.

FINN
Remember me?

FINN
Not anymore. The name's Finn, and
I'm in charge. I'm in charge now,
Phasma. I'm in charge.

HAN
Bring it down. Bring it down.

FINN
Follow me.
Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
behind her.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY

A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
makes her way ACROSS.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off
into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED
SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as
she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY

CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION --
Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. Phasma reluctantly
works controls on the workstation.

FINN
You want me to blast that bucket off
your head? Lower the shields.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
You're making a big mistake.

FINN
Do it.
Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the
controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on

THE WORKSTATION:

FINN (CONT'D)
Solo, if this works, we're not going
to have a lot of time to find Rey.

HAN
Don't worry kid, we won't leave here
without her.
The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED".

CAPTAIN PHASMA
(to Finn, cruel)
You can't be so stupid as to think
this will be easy. My troops will
storm this block and kill you all.

FINN
I disagree. What do we do with her?

HAN
Is there a garbage chute? Trash
compactor?

FINN
Yeah, there is...

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

INT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY

Finn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some
EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. Blast doors nearby.

FINN
We'll use the charges to blow that
blast door. I'll go in and draw
fire, but I'm gonna need cover.

HAN
You sure you're up for this?

FINN
Hell no -- I'll go in find and try
to find Rey --
(improvising, fast)
-- The troopers'll be on our tail.
We have to be ready for that. There's
an access tunnel that'll leads --
(Han starts pointing
with his chin to

SOMETHING BEHIND

FINN)
Why are you doing that? Why are you
doing -- this? I'm trying to come
up with a plan.
Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE
WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't
believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more
grateful than anyone.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

A Resistance Technician turns to Leia:

HAN
Are you all right?

REY
Yeah.

HAN
Good.

FINN
What happened -- did he hurt you?

REY
Finn. What are you doing here?!

FINN
We came back for you.
She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to
do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.

FINN (CONT'D)
What'd he say?

REY
(shrugs, smiles, though
nearly in tears)
... That it was your idea.
Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.

REY (CONT'D)
Thank you.

FINN
How did you get away?

REY
I can't explain it. And you wouldn't
believe it.

HAN
Escape now. Hug later.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out
here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the
lop-sided battle.

THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES.
A long moment of communication.

HAN
They're in trouble. We can't leave.
(to Finn, re: Chewie)
My friend here has a bag full of
explosives. Let's use 'em.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY
STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. Instantly,
Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and
the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true.

ALARMS START BLARING!

INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS

Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service
hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics
of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of
Rey.
And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and:

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout,
step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS.

HAN
That girl knows her stuff.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones.

HAN
We'll set the charges at every other
column.
He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.

HAN (CONT'D)
You're right. That's a better idea.
(checks his detonator)
You take the top.

(CHEWIE DOES)
I'll go down below. Detonator.
We'll meet back here.
They head off in opposite directions.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear
and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS

A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches.
CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation,
Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and
CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure.
SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards.

KYLO REN
Find them.
They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking
carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter.
They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO
CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the
shadows of the grillwork.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Once they're gone, he plants another charge.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY

GONE.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when
he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide,
vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
demeanor changes --
HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
down into the filter.
Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
THAT BISECTS the open space.
Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

HAN
Ben!
The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
catwalk. He turns.

KYLO REN
Han Solo. I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.
Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like
a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing
and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on
the catwalk below.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Take off that mask. You don't need
it.

KYLO REN
What do you think you'll see if I
do?
Han moves toward Kylo Ren.

HAN
The face of my son.
Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face
of his son for the first time as a man.

KYLO REN
Your son is gone. He was weak and
foolish, like his father. So I
destroyed him.

HAN
That's what Snoke wants you to believe
but it's not true. My son is alive.
SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS

Kylo flares.

KYLO REN
No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

HAN
Snoke is using you for your power.
When he gets what he wants, he'll
crush you -- you know it's true.
Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

KYLO REN
It's too late.

HAN
No it's not. Leave here with me.
Come home. We miss you.
For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
flood his stoic eyes...

KYLO REN
I'm being torn apart. I want to be
free of this pain.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS

Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

KYLO REN
I know what I have to do, but I don't
know if I have the strength to do
it. Will you help me?
Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

HAN
Yes. Anything.
Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

VANISHES.
Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH

DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS

OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

KYLO REN
Thank you.
ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --

FINN

(PANTING)
Solo.

REY

(ALSO PANTING)
No, no.
Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his
life slipping away.
Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF

THE STRUCTURE!

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat,

DEVASTATED.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT

Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself
horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when --
CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO
REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers
FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor,
where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON!
Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then
SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the
walls CAVE IN!
Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK --
then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH
ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for
them with long strides.
Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,

REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM

AROUND HER AND DRAGS/CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT!

From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from

rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.

FINN
The Falcon's this way.
Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
they can't run.

Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes
out the saber, ignites it.
A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.

STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.
Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.

KYLO REN
We're not done yet.

REY
You're a monster!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN
It's just us now. Han Solo can't
save you.
After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's
BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey
FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away!
She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.

FINN
Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh
no no no...
Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF
KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO
REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.

KYLO REN

TRAITOR!
In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the
weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
That lightsaber. It belongs to me!

FINN
Come get it.
Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo
Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but
Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!
Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,
COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys
this challenge more!
Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
men fighting, through the trees.
Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!
LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --
wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES
AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK,
the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers:
And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.
Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF
BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses
balance.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO --

LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET!
Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S

LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE.

LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW.
Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN --

-- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!

KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF

REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF,

BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS

SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!
Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING.
Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER.
It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the
defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked
by her raw, innate skill.

INT. X-WING - NIGHT


NIV LEK
We just lost R-1!

JESS
We're overwhelmed! What do we do?
It isn't working!
Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming
from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:

YOLO ZIFF
Black Leader, there's a brand new
hole in that oscillator. Looks like
our friends got in!

POE
Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!

LT. BASTIAN
I'm on it!

ELLO ASTY
Roger!

POE
Everybody else, hit the target hard!
Give it everything you got!
And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the
trench leading to the oscillator structure!

POE
I need some help here! I need some
help!

LT. BASTIAN
I'm coming in!

JESS
Watch out!

ELLO ASTY
I'm hit!
The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.

POE
All teams - I'm going in! Pull up
and cover me!

NIV LEK
Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck,
Poe!
The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts
into the fiery breach.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS

Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH

THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN:

STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
Weapon at full capacity in thirty
seconds.

GENERAL HUX
Prepare to fire.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
volley of torpedoes.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --
and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground

EXPLOSIONS!

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S
BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW
as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A

MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!

KYLO REN
You need a teacher! I can show you
the ways of the Force!

REY
The Force.
Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND

CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
watches this out the control room window in horror. He
hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:

COLONEL DATOO
Lieutenant, get back to your station!

YOUNG TECHNICIAN
(stops, fleetingly)
Just look. We won't survive -- even
Hux has gone!
As he hurries off, WE HEAR:

GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
Supreme Leader.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
but is horrified, heartsick:

GENERAL HUX
The fuel cells have ruptured. The
collapse of the planet has begun.
Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.

SNOKE
Leave the base at once and come to
me with Kylo Ren.

(GRIM)
It is time to complete his training.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.

REY
Finn! Finn...
Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:

LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights

ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!

EXT. FALCON - NIGHT

Chewie exits the ship.
MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
with them back into the ship --

INT. FALCON - NIGHT

Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

INT. X-WING - NIGHT


POE
All teams! I got eyes on them!

SNAP
Yes!
The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
corner of the galaxy.
The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
headed home.

POE
Our job's done here. Let's go home!

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
meet them, usher them inside.

MEDIC
Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
heartbeat.
Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
their losses.
As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
stirs. The droids beep at each other.

C-3PO
R2-D2! You've come back! You found
what? How dare you call me that!

(MORE)





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

C-3PO (CONT'D)
(he swats R2-D2, who

CONTINUES BEEPING)
Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
must go tell the others at once!

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

C-3PO (O.S.)
General? Excuse me, General?
Leia turns to see droids.

C-3PO (CONT'D)
R2-D2 may contain some much needed
good news.

LEIA
Tell me.
Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

POE
Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN

R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

C-3PO
Oh! The map! It is complete!

LEIA
(hand on her heart)
-- Luke --
Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

C-3PO
(to R2-D2)
Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
you.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY

A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
despite her fear:

REY
We'll see each other again. I believe
that. Thank you, my friend.

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

LEIA
Rey.
Rey turns around.

LEIA (CONT'D)
May the Force be with you.
This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
the Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
at him compassionately.
Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

The Millennium Falcon RISES.
Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
journey.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY

A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
with countless GREEN TREES.
The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
the ISLANDS.

EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY

Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
and Rey continues her journey.

EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY

Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY

Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
senses no one.

And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
to her. Pulls back his hood.

IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.

Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
look says it all.

In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
only hope.

HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
of an adventure, just beginning...
